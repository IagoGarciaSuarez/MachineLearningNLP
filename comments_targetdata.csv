0,auto, i have recently purchased a j30t with moderate miles  i shopped for a car that was looked after and paid more for it  as a former auto technician i know what to look for and what to expect yet every time i drive this car i say to my self  dam that s a great car   and yes i truly do  the car affords a level of style and comfort that is beyond compare for the price  i had looked at a number of j30 s with some having covered 160k miles   i checked them to see where the problems show  they were great other than just basic owner neglect the car is extremely quiet and smooth yet does not distance itself from a mild degree of sportiness  performance is smooth yet impressive yet the power is well handled by braking and suspension systems of similar refinement the appointments available with the car were somewhat sparse yet the standard of quality and functionality were apparent  the bose sound system for example has remarkable output and clarity without all the fancy dials  my only complaint  after 15k miles  is a lack of fold down rear seating and slightly high fuel consumption i went from driving a porsche to the infiniti and feel it was a step up in style and understated performance  ,recently purchase moderate miles stop car look pay former auto technical know look expect yet every time drive car say self dam great car yes truly car afford level style comfort beyond compare price look number cover miles check see problems show great basic owner neglect car extremely quiet smooth yet distance mild degree shortness performance smooth yet impressive yet power well handle break suspension systems similar refinement appointments available car somewhat spare yet standard quality functionality apparent bone sound system example remarkable output clarity without fancy deal complaint miles lack fold rear seat slightly high fuel consumption go drive porch infinite feel step style understand performance
1,camera, i bought this product because i need instant gratification  i can t stand the torture of waiting for my photos to come back from the lab  and i don t want to pay extravagant sums for one hour developing  the sony mavica is the perfect solution for the click happy shutterbug who likes to take lots of photos  but doesn t have an in home darkroom or an interest in the nuances of traditional photography the great thing about the mavica is that you can take a photo and instantly see how it turned out on the built in color lcd display  if it sucked  take it again until you get it right  non digital cameras don t come close to offering this feature with film  you take the photo and cross your fingers  if it s a one time shot  forget it  when you re using the sony mavica  you can try a variety of shots  with or without flash  and look at the photos until you get what you want  you can take black and white photos or add a  quot sepia quot  effect that looks like an old tyme photo that you get at the county fair a standard high density floppy disk is your  quot film quot  and holds about a ton of standard resolution photos  great for internet use  and half that amount of high resolution pix that you can print out on your printer one criticism that i have heard about this product is that it does not produce the glossy  permanent prints that you get when you use a film camera  if you are willing to spend some extra money  you can get a decent inkjet printer for a few hundred bucks that  when used with special photo paper  prints photos that look a lot like traditional prints  if you go this route and are willing to learn some software  you will get permanent prints that are superior to those that you get from the photo lab you can correct red eye and other common problems  adjust contrast and color just as you do on your tv  and even remove your finger or the camera strap from the shot  you can print wallets and 8 quot x10 quot s to your heart s desire without paying for reprints  the newer mavicas can store a minute long mpeg movie  complete with sound  and like i said  the photo lab people never see your photos  start your own  ahem  website  ooh la la the fact that this camera uses floppy disks poses a problem for some computer owners  people with windows based pcs generally have floppy drives and can use the sony mavica disks  the imacs  however  don t come with a floppy drive  you ll have to shell out some extra bucks for one if you want to use your mavica  since i don t think you can connect usb cables like with some other digital cameras if you do consider a mavica  take note of the useful features that you get with the higher end models  and be sure to get a decent printer and some photo quality paper to get the most out of your purchase br br  ,buy product need instant gratification stand torture wait photo come back lab want pay extravagant sum one hour develop sonya mavra perfect solution click happy shutterbug like take lot photo home darkroom interest glance traditional photography great thing mavra take photo instantly see turn build color lead display suck take get right non digital camera come close offer feature film take photo cross finger one time shoot forget use sonya mavra try variety shots without flash look photo get want take black white photo add quit septa quit effect look like old time photo get county fair standard high density floppy disk quit film quit hold ton standard resolution photo great internet use half amount high resolution six print printer one criticism hear product produce glossy permanent print get use film camera will spend extra money get decent inject printer hundred buck use special photo paper print photo look lot like traditional print go route will learn software get permanent print superior get photo lab correct red eye common problems adjust contrast color even remove finger camera strap shoot print wallet quit heart desire without pay reprint newer magical store minute long peg movie complete sound like say photo lab people never see photo start webster ooh la fact camera use floppy disk pose problem computer owners people windows base pus generally floppy drive use sonya mavra disk mass however come floppy drive shell extra buck one want use mavra since think connect us table like digital camera consider mavra take note useful feature get higher end model sure get decent printer photo quality paper get purchase br
2,auto, i have owned my buick since 53000 km and i am now approaching 60000 on it  i must say it s the nicest car i ve owned and driven in a while  i previously owned a 1995 grand am which doesn t compare at all to the buick  i have also test driven a 2002 malibu  i have also rented a lincoln continental which i think is almost comparable to this vehicle  but not quite i was very pleasantly surprised by all of the basic features on this model  there is an indicator light for low fuel  low washer fluid  change engine oil soon  low tire pressure to name a few  as well  the three built in tether hooks in the back for car seats are a must have for me as i have two small children  i took a while to get used to the size of the car as i was previously in a smaller car  as well due to the high back  i m still not entirely comfortable when backing up  i tend to over estimate the size of the back  i would rate this vehicle average to above average on acceleration  due to it s size and weight  it s not a sports car and i don t think it was meant to appeal to that type of consumer  i find that overall the buick century is easy to handle  it s a great car at a reasonable price  you can also read some more info on this car by copying and pasting this link to your browser http auto consumerguide com auto used reviews full index cfm id 2287 htm happy car shopping  ,own quick since km approach must say nicest car own drive previously own grand compare quick also test drive malice also rent lincoln continental think almost comparable vehicle quite pleasantly surprise basic feature model indicator light low fuel low wash fluid change engine oil soon low tire pressure name well three build ether hook back car seat must two small children take get use size car previously smaller car well due high back still entirely comfortable back tend estimate size back would rate vehicle average average acceleration due size weight sport car think mean appeal type consumer find overall quick century easy handle great car reasonable price also read car copy pass link brother http auto consumerguide com auto use review full index cf id htm happy car shop
3,camera, this was my first digital camera so i did quite a bit of research  unfortunately  pic quality is not everything as i found out  the camera is really cool and takes great pics but the viewer is a bad place  by that i mean that whenever i take a picture i leave a nose print on the lcd screen  it s also a drag to have to slide the lens protector back and forth to turn it on and off  one other big time bummer is that it doesn t come with an ac adapter  fortunately  i have a smartmedia reader so i don t have to drain my batteries while downloading pics  one other thing the manual is a damn shame  it looks as if somebody that was about to go on vacation wrote it  i can t recommend this camera because i m not in love it it i just own it  it wasn t a waste of money but if i know then what i know now i would have bought something else  hope this helps  p s  the batteries it takes 4 aa batteries and it consumes them like mad  invest in rechargeable is all i can recommend  ,first digital camera quite bite research unfortunately pick quality everything find camera really cool take great pick viewer bad place mean whenever take picture leave nose print lead screen also drag slide lens protector back forth turn one big time summer come ac adapt fortunately smartmedia reader drain batteries download pick one thing manual damn shame look somebody go vacation write recommend camera love waste money know know would buy something else hope help batteries take batteries consume like mad invest rechargeable recommend
4,camera, minolta dimage 7hi is in a digital slr with 5 megapixel 2 3  ccd sensor class  currently also populated by nikon s coolpix 5700  sony s dsc f717  and minolta s own dimage 7i  besides the high pixel count  these cameras  larger  better sensors and lenses  compared to 1 1 8  format and smaller digicams  result in better tonality  sharper images these days  it seems that digital cameras become obsolete the moment they are manufactured  minolta dimage 7hi comes barely 6 months after the introduction of its similar looking sibling  the 7i what compelled minolta to release an upgrade this soon  what makes the 7hi stand out  should you choose it or another camera in its class minolta  one of the  big three  camera makers  besides canon and nikon  and the second most profitable one of the three  is the only one of the bunch that s been for a while without a digital 35mm format slr body that would work with their lenses  therefore  it appears  they feel the extra pressure to deliver viable  performance and cost wise  digital photography options to those of minolta users who are advanced photographers this is very evident in 7hi  it feels and works like a real photographic camera that happens to be a digital camera  as opposed to a digital age gadget that takes pictures that so many digital cameras are  its performance  shutter lag  delay between you pressing the button and the camera taking the picture  frames per second speed and count for continuous shooting  time to ready after the shot  image retrieval  and focusing speed  are all at the top of its class   state of the art  7hi s focusing system is fast and features an option for you to have the camera focus on any point in the frame   things mentioned so far in this paragraph are all improvements on top of minolta s own dimage 7i s already impressive performance 7hi s zoom control is a well dampened and smoothly operating ring that s mechanically linked to optical elements  allowing a very fast  precise  and tactile control of the focal length  by contrast  competitors in its class only offer a  zoom by wire   electronically emulated zoom ring  or  worse  t w zoom buttons  i e  camcorder style zoom controls  7hi s high legibility display shows image histogram  distribution chart of light and dark parts in the image  in recording and playback modes  allowing you to monitor and optimize exposure  its lens covers a span from the highly useful  relatively wide in 35mm film camera terms 28mm to the telephoto 200mm  with very little distortion throughout the range   sony dsc f717 s lens only opens up to 38mm or so at the widest overall the camera has a solid  quality feel  it comes from the shape and surface of the grip  and from how the various dials and controls operate  i ve played with the minolta 7i and the nikon 5700 at the store when i was picking the 7hi  and to me  the 7hi as a camera had the best feel of the three overall the camera works with minolta s impressive flash system  including the powerful 5600hs  that even works wirelessly while preserving ttl   through the lens exposure metering  two excellent macro flashes  great for flowers   other close ups  and a cheaper and less powerful midrange flash  there s also a pc sync socket to trigger studio   generic flashes  no ttl with those though  but with a digicam  you do see the results right away  there are other features that are too numerous to mention here  that may come useful to some photographers now that you know what s great about this camera  here s what isn t  there is some grain like noise evident in the images  this is especially visible when photographing smooth flat areas of a given color in subdued light  particularly if that color is blue  this is a typical and fundamental problem for all digicams  and i would say is not far out of line with the other prosumer 5mp slr competition  but i wish 7hi were the best in this regard as well  no video capture mode in the true sense of the word  i know it s a gimmick  but i like the idea of having a video mode on a digicam  even if it s a 320 x 240 pixels x 15fps for a few seconds  this camera s cpu speed and buffer size would with little doubt allow for at least 320 x 240 x 30fps or 640 x 480 x 15fps  both highly useful for the web streaming media  it s a shame that minolta did not include this capability  they did provide 7fps capture at an even higher resolution  the capacity of the supplied compactflash card is pathetic  the camera battery performance  using the excellent nimh batteries supplied with the product  is average by today s standards  i am typically getting around 200 shots per charge with my typical flash and af use  and maybe 250 if no flash is used and no extensive focus   refocus   try again af activity takes place  fortunately  7hi uses  4  aa s  so it is easy to get cost effective extra batteries  such as the ones recommended below  i wish they made the camera usb 2 0 enabled  it s usb1 1

6,auto, nissan has needed a redesign of the sentra since 1997  that model was economical and affordable but difficult to look at  along comes the fresh looking sentra for 2000   and not a minute too soon  however  nissan has taken that car a step further now offering many different models based on that one  well built and sporty canvas  the sentra is available in se  xe  gxe and se r trim levels  should you want to enjoy an affordable and sporty sedan while saving the planet  nissan has you covered there as well  the nissan sentra ca  short for clean air  is an attempt to sell you the social consciousness of an electric car with the fun and convenience of a normal car   is there anything this platform can t do to the casual observer  the sentra ca looks just like a normal compact car  well  normal for nissan  their cars do have a bit of style that seems to be missing in others such as the corolla  civic  cavalier etc  remember when the nissan maxima was advertised as a  four door sports car  and when magazine ads touted the old sentra se r as the spiritual predecessor to the datsun 510 and bmw 2002  one can only hope nissan is getting back to the good ole days of performance and style  back to the sentra ca  it looks like a normal car  with the exception of the large  clean air vehicle  decals stuck to the rear doors  nissan says they can be  easily removed  but also points out that a least one customer was upset when the unsightly decals were removed without his her permission  sounds reasonable  half the fun of buying an environmentally friendly car is letting everyone else know that you are not  part of the problem  how selfless other than the decals  the sentra ca is quite unremarkable  in fact the car is notable for it s unremarkable ness from behind the wheel  one would never suspect the space age technology being utilized under the hood  double walled exhaust  quick catalyst warm up and a radiator that has a special coating which actually changes ground level ozone  smog  into oxygen   this car is cleaning the air   it also meets california s strict sulev emissions requirements for the year 2004  frankly the sentra ca is the cleanest burning gas engine currently for sale  and most drivers will never sense anything different when compared to other compact sedans  the 1 8l engine produces 122 hp  that is 5 less than a non ca sentra  but it s hard to notice on the road  acceleration is adequate  but typically cars in this price range  about  15 000  are anything but powerful  merging onto the freeway is no problem  can t wait for the sentra se r  road noise is minimal for a small car  and the automatic transmission shifts smoothly  the main  or perhaps only  drawback to the sentra ca is what seems to be a higher than normal overdrive ratio  at times the sentra seems to bog down under light acceleration  my suspicion is that this is done purposely to keep engine rpms down  thereby lessening emissions  handling is precise and a huge improvement over previous sentras  the sentra has a sportiness to it similar to the honda civic  but which is lacking on the corolla inside the sentra ca is a basic  normal car interior  nissan has improved the materials used inside the sentra  the overall look and feel is much more pleasing  the dash  audio controls  seats and gauges all have the look and feel of a car costing much more  am fm cd is standard  but a cassette player is nowhere to be found  people do still listen to cassettes don t they  i must be getting old  the stereo actually sounds very good and rivals the stock stereo found in the honda insight and civic  button and switches fall nicely to hand  nissan has included a nifty storage area on the top part of the dash  not so unusual  but this one is covered  finally a place to keep sunglasses out of sight and out of the hot sun  rear seat room is a bit cramped  but then again this is a small car  overall  the 2001 sentra ca is reasonably adequate car  it does everything it s asked to  and more  there really is nothing exceptional about this little car  and that is just how it should be  many people don t want to ruin the environment  it s just that they want to not ruin the environment in as simple a way as possible  nissan has answered the call  no charging stations  no limited driving range and no hassle  besides  the sentra is good looking car as well  what more could you ask   save the planet  don t look dorky  it s just that simple  ,nissan need design sentry since model economical unfordable difficult look along come fresh look sentry minute soon however nissan take car step offer many different model base one well build sport canvas sentry available se gee se trim level want enjoy unfordable sport sedan save planet nissan cover well nissan sentry ca short clean air attempt sell social consciousness electric car fun convenience normal car anything platform casual observer sentry ca look like normal compact car well normal nissan cars bite style seem miss others coolly civic cavalier etc remember nissan maxim advertise four door sport car magazine rout old sentry se spiritual predecessor watson bow one hope nissan get back good ole days performance style back sentry ca look like normal car exception large clean air vehicle deal stick rear doors nissan say easily remove also point least one customer upset unsightly deal remove without permission sound reasonable half fun buy environmental friendly car let everyone else know part problem helpless deal sentry ca quite remarkable fact car notable remarkable ness behind wheel one would never suspect space age technology utilize hood double wall exhaust quick cataclysm warm radiate special coat actually change grind level ozone oxygen car clean

7,camera, the 3040 represents a new advance in digital cameras  complete with super fast f 1 8 lens  tremendous range of practical user controls and  most importantly  fabulous pictures  just finished two beautiful 5x7 portrait enlargements of the kids for framing that meets or beats the quality of my old nikon 35 mm system  photo quality being  after all  job one  the olympus shines in that department  especially when using the higher quality photo setting  in olympus parlance shq mode  quirks abound  nonetheless  for seriously 35mm photogs  as i was in the digital dark ages  perhaps the single biggest adjustment on the 3040 and other digital cameras is the lag between pressing the shutter release and picture being taken  the 1 2 seconds delay  which can seem considerably longer  can interrupt the timing of shots but  with some practice  one learns to adapt and make do  a quirk more unique to olympus the popping out of the lens upon turning the camera on accompanied by the popping off of the lens cap  should you forget to remove it yourself  is associated with a rather alarming but apparently harmless grinding sound  solution  tether that cap to the camera with a cord that olympus has  finally  provided  it was not on the original c 3030  and remember to simply pop it off each time you turn the camera on problem solved  more troublesome was the woefully inadequate download instructions in the otherwise fairly decent manual  which thankfully includes an index  olympus actually has pretty good download instructions on their website  which they ll also send you if you email them  but i wasted many hours struggling to download before uncovering the elusive instructions online  why they failed to include these instruction in the manual is a mystery that only olympus can  and should  explain  and forget about getting a live person on the phone i tried multiple times for several hours without success  once mastered  however  downloading via usb is a snap and works like a charm  the camedia software is very rudimentary but easy to use and functional on to the good stuff the fabulous creative options  my favorites  35mm motor drive style setting  a tremendous advantage with digital enabling rapid shooting  a dozen shots in seconds  though not with flash  in which you can quickly discard the bad shots and keep the good ones great for shooting

can see key information  f stop  shutter speed  iso  on the monitor screen accompanying each picture for a few seconds  should you choose to  more good stuff  the fast f1 8 lens allows for more available light shots without flash and greater ability to throw the background out of focus for softer  more appealing portraits  batteries  picked up four nimh with charger for about  25 at radio shack still going strong after two days of extensive use  the camera body feels right  at least in my hands good weight  balance  and is just small enough to stick in a pants pocket should you choose to  best of all  picture quality  including incredible enlargements  the c 3040 in shq mode can produce 8x10 portraits of quality sharpness and color  totally suitable for framing and displaying  if you re looking for high quality photos  fast lens  user friendly body and are willing to live with a few minor quirks  you d be hard pressed to beat the c 3040 at this price point  ,represent new

8,camera,    from olympus to kodak  b i enjoyed using an olympus d450z for about a year  read my detailed epinion on this product to know more  but i eventually wanted a camera that would give  easier access to manual functions   because the numerous steps needed to bypass the automatic functions of the d450z led me to use it like a point and shoot most of the time offer a  direct usb connection  to download photos to my desktop and notebook be more  sturdy   the lesser the plastic  the better translate  accurate colors   my oly d450z always had a blue tint be  widely available   so that an eventual repair wouldn t leave me without a camera for months  which was unfortunately the case in my previous experience with olympus having access to higher resolutions  such as 3 1 mega pixels  wasn t an incentive to change my camera  but i eventually came to the conclusion that it sure wouldn t hurt if i ever want to have some of my works printed out after many price and features comparisons  i chose the kodak dc4800  i waited to use it extensively before writing about it here  after two months of usage  i think i m ready to share my thoughts with you b  a success in design and ergonomics  b the dc 4800 s design is  in my opinion  a real achievement in ergonomics  all the accessible buttons are well placed on the casing  so you don t constantly have to look at what you re doing  after just a few minutes playing with it  your fingers will do the working the casing feels very solid  but the two plastic doors  for connectivity and the memory card  looks like they could break at any time  also  the only button that i don t like is the power button  you have to push it very hard and low  probably to prevent unintended shutdowns or powering  and i personally prefer when electronic material that reacts to a light touch you could pretty well use this camera as a point and shoot if you d like to  but as the widely used manual settings have been put on the casing of the camera  you ll enjoy manually overriding the automatic settings  and contrary to many point and shoot  you don t constantly have to browse through a hierarchy of menus to set it up  here are the functions accessible manually b self timer   to chose the moment your camera will triggers itself b burst mode   to take 4 pictures in sequence  at the lowest picture quality  you can take up to 16 b landscape   to prevent the camera from focusing on a near subject and have the horizon in focus b close up   to let the camera adjust the focus to take a subject between 0 7 2 3 feet in great details   b flash and flash settings   will let you chose between flash  no flash  red eye b exposure compensation   from  2 to  2  this will let you chose to over  or underexpose your subject  to adapt to various light conditions b aperture   f 8  f 5 6  f 2 8  you can decide on the depth of field  so that you can have sharpness and blurriness where you like it on your photos  you can also choose p for the automatic settings to take over b zoom  in out  you get a 3x physical zoom  and also a 2x digital  which adds up to the 3x automatically when you press the zoom button long enough  you could also choose to block your camera from entering the digital zoom mode  to prevent yourself from using it  i have yet to see a photo which benefited the use of the digital zoom  they re always grainy  not only with the kodak s digital zoom  but with all those i tried i would have liked to access the iso settings and exposure modes manually  but these have been put on menus accessible on the lcd  also  the optical viewfinder could be a little bigger b  limited memory for your memories  b the kodak dc4800 comes with a 16 mb compact flash memory card  which is a complete nonsense for a 3 1 mega pixels camera  at 3 1 mp  you ll be able to fit  1  yes  one  uncompressed picture on it  if you compromise and add compression  you ll have 15  light compression  or 32  high compression  you could also choose to use less mega pixels  then you d fit  21   2 2  28   1 6 and 47   0 8 needless to say that you ll soon have to consider adding another compact flash to your starting kit  i personally went for 48 mb  on which i can fit 5 pictures   3 1 uncompressed mega pixels  i rarely use it  48   3 1  light compression  63   2 2  85   1 6 and 143   0 8     vivid colors and great details  b let me now get to the main point of interest  picture quality  kodak s digital pictures are known for their vivid colors  and the dc4800 reaffirms this reputation  the default color mode setting is at  saturated  which contributes to the vivacity of the colors  if you prefer  you can go for the normal mode  or even shoot in black and white or sepia you can also adjust the white balance manually  which will sure be very useful as i live in a country of snow  i m in qu bec  i still have to experiment with this function  though  because i sometimes end up with a greenish tint on my photos when i override the default white balance settings also  the 3 1 mega pixels will give you incredibly crisps and sharp details  even if you use low compression  but you ll eventually lose it if you use a high compression mode  which i don t recommend  the most annoying problem i had so far with the dc4800 is its inability to focus in low light conditions  it rarely focuses on the subject i want to photograph  but looks for any source of light and focus at that point  it gets annoying to have sofas and tables focused when people around are all blurry  as for the flash  it doesn t wash the picture as much as my olympus  did  but still  i don t like using it  preferring to play with ambient lighting     batteries down  down and down again  b my main complaint with the dc4800 goes to the battery  while aa nimh rechargeable batteries in my olympus d450z lasted for hours and hours of shooting with the ldc screen always turned on  kodak s proprietary li ion battery that s used in the dc4800 doesn t impress me at all  if i keep the lcd on  it doesn t last more than 40 pictures  after which the lcd turns itself off  i can keep shooting without it for a while  but i don t like it at all  first  the optical viewfinder is too small  second  some of the main functions such as the iso metering  shutter speed and white balance  are only accessible through the lcd screen  i suggest investing in an extra battery  consider the kit that includes a charger  it s 10  more than buying the battery alone  and it will recharge your batteries in 40 minutes  there s also the dc4800 expansion kit that will include the battery and charger  plus a decent carrying bag  a cleaning lens pen and an inkjet sheets sample pack   that s the one i chose and i m happy with it  the charger is very portable  and it won t be a problem to carry it around in your camera bag b  a few words on accessories  b b neck strap   useful to prevent dropping the camera  but it is so i d prefer a wrist strap  if you plan on using it  be careful  though  that the lcd may get scratched if you have hard buttons on your chest   b lens cover    it falls down pretty easily  so you might want to consider fixing it to the casing with a small cord   b lithium ion battery   this is a proprietary format  which is apparently also used in some other brands  so if you go on a trip b ac adapter for in camera charging   this takes very long  up to 4 hours  i strongly recommend buying a kit including a fast charger and an extra battery b usb cable   perfect to transfer the pictures to most recent computers  mac or pcs b video out cable  for viewing pictures on tv  never used it b kodak software   it installed like a charm on my desktop computer  but my sony vaio couldn t go through the whole installation  i ended up installing the drivers manually  searching for them on my desktop and copying them one by one on the vaio  painful operation  but it now works perfectly on both computers  when evaluating the cost of the dc4800  consider you ll very soon what to buy these extra accessories b high capacity compact flash memory card   consider at least 48 mb b expansion pack for the dc4800   item 1174770   100  you ll get li ion battery  li ion battery charger  premium camera bag  inkjet sample pack  5   4 x 6 sheets  and a lens pen  you could also go only for the battery  70  the battery and charger  80  as you can see  for only 20  more  you get quite a lot with the expansion pack  which i recommend strongly you may eventually consider buying extra lenses  in which case you ll also need to spend 25  on the lense adapter  it came as a promotion with mine  ,polypus today enjoy use polypus year read detail opinion product know eventually want camera would give easier access manual function

9,camera, many years ago  i was deeply in 35mm photography  i had a full gadget bag with several lenses  filters  sunshades  reflectors  flashgun  tripod  exposure meter and of course several different cans of film  i also had a darkroom with an enlarger and all the chemicals and trays  i even had a developing tank and a place to hang drying prints  now all this was just for black and white photography  today  i ve replaced all that with a few ounces of fully integrated digital camera that easily fits in a pocket  the film is now a mini disk about the size of a postage stamp  my pc has replaced the dark room  i no longer have to buy film or chemicals or flashbulbs  and best of all  i can view my pictures in full color in minutes  edit them quite rapidly and share them with friends and family around the world almost instantly  i am a true believer in modern photographic technology digital cameras seemed to come in two flavors  low cost toys and high priced professional tools  now one of the premier camera manufacturers  olympus  has released an affordable  full featured camera  the d 360l  that has evolved from their successful d 340r film less digital camera  this is not just a low cost version of the award winning d 340r  but the d 360l is a completely redefine the entry level class camera  the street price is less than  300  and amazingly it has all the convenient features you need in a film less digital camera  including a compact  lightweight design  low price  all glass aspherical lens system  and 2x digital telephoto mode  its features compare quite favorably with cameras costing twice as much or more  the picture quality results from the 1 3 mega pixel ccd  charge coupled device  array  that functions much like a scanner  there are several choices in mode of picture quality  again analogous to a scanner that allow you to choose between quality level and the number of pictures that can be stored  there is an 8 mb  smart card  replaceable media memory card that stores the pictures and is in essence  the film  this smart card has panoramic capability so that you may take panoramic photos  there are cards of various capacities available that range up to 32 mb  the included 8 mb card can store up to 122 pictures  depending upon the quality level selected  for example  standard quality  640 x 480 pixels  can have up to the 122 pictures while super high quality  1600 x 1200 pixels  can have as few as 2 pictures stored  there are several choices in between  again  think of your scanner and the pictures produced by the different quality settings  standard features include selectable iso ratings  exposure compensation  selectable digital  esp  matrix  spot metering  auto or preset manual white balance  two compression ratios in standard quality mode for more imaging options  and a six mode automatic flash with a new slow synchro flash the auto flash system automatically fires in low light and the fill in flash can fire with every shot  erasing shadows and providing balanced illumination there is an lcd  liquid crystal display  monitor that you can use to show a wysiwyg  full color view of the picture that you are about to take  you may also view all the pictures stored in the camera on this monitor  individual pictures can be erased and the memory space released for another shot  try that with film  you may choose to conserve battery power by turning off the monitor and using the optical viewfinder to frame your picture  there are auto focus marks within the viewfinder to help compose the picture  just press the shutter release half way and you lock in the focus and exposure settings  a green light tells you when the camera is ready to press the shutter release all the way to capture the picture  it s hard to go wrong  since you need keep only the photos that you want other features include  sequential shooting  a shutter release timer  date time imprinting capability and picture indexing  it is hard to imagine any normally useful feature that has been omitted  and best of all  they all work as advertised the control panel shows you the camera status  including the state of battery charge  the number of storable pictures  the flash mode  the quality level  the white balance setting  the self timer setting  the spot metering mode  the shooting mode  and just about all the operating parameters and settings  there is no guesswork  you are always presented with all the information  the batteries can be 4 aa alkaline  4 nimh batteries  aa lithium batteries or aa nicd batteries  you have a full range of choices the standard package includes  the camera  an 8 mb smart media card  a wrist strap  4 aa batteries  a cd containing the camedia software  a great fully illustrated manual that leads you through all operations  an rs 232 cable for connecting to the serial port on a pc and a video cable for connecting to a tv to view your pictures the camedia software will allow you to manipulate and edit your photos  once they are in your computer  you may use the rs 232 cable to download the camera to the pc or any of the third party devices especially made for this purpose  there is an optional power supply available so that you may operate the camera from a standard household outlet  you can really show off your work by using the video cable to attach your camera to any standard tv  i can t say enough about the manual  it is written in fully understandable english and the illustrations are annotated and leave no room for doubt about each action  it is truly one of the best manuals that i have ever seen  there is also a quick start sheet that gets you up and running almost instantly  the attached illustration is from that sheet  this is a concise  clear source of the essentials needed to start taking pictures  in summary  if you have been hesitant to acquire a digital camera because of the high initial cost of a full featured model  hesitate no longer

10,auto,    general trooper information  b the isuzu trooper has been produced for over twenty years worldwide  and is respected in many countries for it 146s off road prowess and reliability  sadly  it hasn 146t received such a warm welcome in the united states  and was canceled in 2002  there 146s only one thing i blame for the downfall of the trooper  and that would be the consumer reports hack n slash job on the 1996 trooper  their story was the ultimate naderism  and caused such a furor that sales on the trooper fell abysmally  after various strategies and incentives failed  isuzu canceled the trooper in 2002 due to lack of sales volume the 1994 trooper i own is considered a 3rd generation model  and it was produced from 1992 until 1997  there were several option packages available  from the basic trooper s up to the fully loaded le  just as the  a href content 82526768772 b rodeo  a  was cross branded as the honda passport  so the trooper was marketed as a acura slx  you 146ll find the same powertrain and most interior pieces are the same between both models  since the resale value on both models is about the same  you may want to look for an acura since they did have more gadgets and marginally upscale interiors  the trooper is much easier to locate since they sold at a much faster rate than the slx b  my trooper experience  b my trooper is a 1994 trooper s v6 with the 5 speed manual transmission  it has only the standard options  which makes it quite loaded by 1994s standards  it had 89k miles when i purchased it  and was it very good condition  i have since added an alarm system  remote keyless entry  custom wheels and tires  and an upgraded stereo system b overall appearance  i really like the way the 3rd generation trooper looks from every angle  especially my all white version  the ls models had two tone paint jobs  with the bumpers and lower cladding a different color  the overall look is tall and muscular  with the obvious priority being interior space  from the back the trooper looks quite large  as the rear door area is quite square  the side view puts this suv in better proportion  as you can see the large hood offsets the bulky body  the only ugly parts on a stock trooper are those hideous wheels  i really wonder what some manufacturers are thinking when they specify wheels for a new model   147well guys  we know people will never agree on what looks great on our new suv  so why don 146t we choose the most ugly wheel in our catalog  then they 146ll have to buy new rims 148 isuzu should take notice of the wheels jeep puts on their grand cherokee and wrangler models  subtle yet stylish  the wheels on the trooper are dished inwards  and look like an oversized pie pan only inverted  i chose to add  m b  motoring  shock wheels in a 7 5 148 x 16 148 size  these put my tires about 1 5 148 wider on each side  and let me fit 245 75 16 nitto terra grappler tires without a lift and still have no rubbing  the rims and tires are obviously not necessary  and were purely personal preference  i will say my trooper looks much nicer with its new wheels b interior appearance   comfort  the inside of the trooper takes a little while to get used to  for one thing  a 6 146 tall man will have 6 7 148 of room above his head when he sits down  this suv does have loads of head room  and a very generous amount of leg and knee room as well  this goes for the back seat too  and the rear seat is also wide enough to seat two adults for any length of time in comfort  for some reason the front seats are slightly firmer  and give you better support over long distances  on a 1300 mile trip this fall  the back seat passengers were always asking to stop before the front seats  as i said before  it 146s not the room that is the problem  but more the composition of the seat material the dash controls are laid out in an fairly accessible manner  and most functions are easily reachable without focusing on them too much  the learning curve for the controls can be steep for those of us used to american vehicles  the main problem you might run into will involve the wiper and headlight controls  for some reason  isuzu decided to put them both on the dash instead of the steering column where god intended them to be  after almost 10 000 miles of being the sole driver of my trooper  i still turn off my headlights when i mean to turn off the wipers  it doesn 146t help that they are both exactly the same size and shape  a lesser annoyance is the placement of the main cruise switch and the rear wiper switch  they are placed on either side of the steering column on the dash  and right behind the steering wheel spokes  you have to feel around for them at night until you are familiar with their location now for the good points  the 5 speed shifter feels very smooth for a truck transmission  one thing that seems so unimportant but which i 146ve really come to enjoy are the pull handles on all five doors  just slide your hand into the handle and pull out  no thumb jamming or button pushing required  i also appreciate the lighted window switchgear  it 146s a nice touch for those dark nighttime drives  standard power mirrors are a nice feature on any base model suv  but isuzu went the extra mile with heated and folding mirrors  the heaters are selectable with a handy on off switch  and those narrow garage doors are easier to navigate when you push the mirror button and watch the mirrors fold into the door  power locks allow you lock or unlock all five doors from the driver 146s door  and simplify the entry of multiple passengers  fit and finish on the interior materials is mid level at best  but still acceptable for a mid 90s suv  the cloth is a very stain resistant material  and much nicer in cold weather than leather  the interior of most troopers will be the dark gray theme of my truck  and it 146s great for those too lazy to clean  tan and black both show the dirt much worse than gray  so three cheers for monochromatic color schemes  i really prefer the lower end interior trim instead of the fake wood and rabbit fur trim on the  147high end 148 ls  i 146m driving an import suv thank you  not my grandparents olds 88 regency brougham  since i don 146t have kids of my own  i can 146t comment on child seat installation  but the rear doors do open wide enough to comfortably stand in the opening to position your kidlets in their seats  the 3 rd gen trooper is too old to be equipped with the latch child seat system  so you 146re stuck with the old seatbelt rigmarole the rear seatbacks are adjustable  which is a rare feature in this class of suvs  they recline far enough to get comfortable and rest  to fold the seats down  you only need pull the recline button and move the seatback forward  this will bring the seatbacks to a level position  but they most definitely don 146t fold into the floor  you 146ll have to wrestle with the seat bolts and remove both rear seats for maximum cargo capacity  this isn 146t a job you want to assign to your wife  since both rear seats are heavy and bulky  normally this isn 146t a problem  since there is a large amount of storage behind the upright seats  the rear doors are of the 2 3 1 3 variety  with the larger left door opening first  this is preferable to the  147dutch 148 doors on suburbans and astro vans  usually i only need to open the left door  so access is easy with the large opening  there is a latch on the bottom that locks when the door is fully open  which is useful on a hill or when it 146s windy outside b  performance   handling  b the stock 3 2 liter v6 is adequate for everyday duties  and is surprisingly gutsy up to 35 mph  the 188 ftlbs of torque are to thank for the trooper 146s low end grunt  but 175 hp isn 146t quite enough for this 4 300 lb truck to cruise comfortably on the freeway  the onramp acceleration speeds are acceptable  but nothing to write home about  above 75 mph the trooper 146s design elements begin to work against it  its boxy shape gives it a lot of cargo room for its size  but also endows it with the aerodynamics of a barn  side winds buffet the trooper slightly more than other suvs  although it feels unsettling more than dangerous  after driving my trooper at least 5 000 interstate miles i 146ve found it rides better with a medium load  which is evidence of the truck based body on frame design  i can say the trooper rides much nicer than isuzu 146s  a href content 82526768772 b rodeo  a  mostly due to the coil sprung rear axle  coil springs generally give a more progressive suspension movement and a better  more compliant ride  this is definitely the case with the trooper  and this helps to keep the hideous potholes at bay on the frozen roads of the midwest  brakes have an excellent feel  and stop predictably when needed  braking distances seem to be average for an suv  although 4 wheel anti lock was only an option in 1994  handling is better than you would expect for a vehicle of the trooper 146s size and height  while it does have a large degree of body roll  it will stick to a corner at much higher speeds than most will want to attempt  slalom type maneuvers are accomplished with moderate body sway  and a little drivetrain shudder  the emergency lane change was where consumer reports nailed the trooper for rolling over  and this was later proven to have been a biased report  other auto magazines attempted to recreate this situation  and failed to achieve a rollover  while this is essentially a truck  and it has limitations like all suvs  i don 146t consider the trooper any more prone to rolling than any other suv of the mid 90s  one more thing  the 1998 2002 models were heavier and consequently had a higher center of gravity  so the earlier models aren 146t as top heavy as the newest generation  i would choose the 5 speed manual transmission over the automatic for this vehicle  since the auto robs more power from the merely adequate engine  it also does not shift quickly or firmly  and feels very sluggish in city traffic b  what about the competition   b the trooper 146s main competitors are the toyota 4runner  jeep cherokee  ford explorer  and chevrolet blazer  the 4runner is admittedly a better vehicle  both in fit   finish and in quality  the 3 0l six cylinder engine is comparable in both power and real world performance  it 146s definitely smaller inside  so both passenger and cargo space suffer  it also costs up to twice as much used as a trooper  you get what you pay for  so for those on a budget the trooper is going to look better jeep has been working on its cherokee model for almost 20 years  so even in the mid 90s it was a well sorted out vehicle  i 146ve had the pleasure of riding in several cherokees  and these are my conclusions  the cherokee is by nature a better off road vehicle  and can tackle incredibly difficult terrain in stock form  it has a better auto transmission  and when equipped with the 4 0l inline six will perform very well both on the highway and in the city  where it falls behind everyone else in this class is interior refinement  a 1994 cherokee still feels very much like a truck inside  and rides like one too  for a family that needs 4wd and a strong frame based vehicle  the cherokee deserves a close look  anyone that will see most of their miles on the highway should head towards a 4runner or trooper  which are both better asphalt suvs i haven 146t owned a mid 90s ford explorer  so i can 146t give you factual data for a comparison  i do know some casual friends that have owned them  and reactions are mixed  while cheap to repair like most american made vehicles  90s explorers will be having more than their share of breakdowns by this time  and this is proven by their poor reliability scores  they also have a propensity to rust under the doors and around the rear wheels  i would personally recommend the explorer to someone the gm blazer jimmy twins were always popular in the northern states due to their relative low cost  and the fact they were available in 4wd and several body configurations  while they do carry a reliability history somewhat better than the explorer  it 146s still a notch below jeep and the imports  many of the interior features feel  147cheap 148  even on upper end slt models  for some reason gm can 146t seem to design a seat that is comfortable for long distances  or include heated   folding side mirrors    one point for isuzu   the gm twins strong point is definitely their 4 3l v6 and transmission  if you like speed and need to tow a reasonable sized trailer  take a closer look at the blazer jimmy twins b  trooper negatives  b it 146s not all roses for the trooper  and there are some rather annoying issues that plague other isuzu models  the geriatric 3 2l engine is actually sourced from gm  and is not what anyone would describe as a modern powerplant  it has a notorious valvetrain ticking problem that while not a true reliability problem  it can be downright annoying  another problem that has plagued both my  a href content 82526768772 b rodeo  a  and trooper is poor quality lock cylinders  these locks just won 146t work right  and replacement is somewhat expensive  you must resort to unlocking other doors and reaching across the truck  or get the cylinders replaced  since the trooper and the  a href content 82526768772 b rodeo  a  share the same manual transmission  it 146s no surprise they share the same parts failures  the slave cylinder for the clutch apparently fails at around 70 80k miles  and slowly leaks until your clutch won 146t disengage  this is exactly the opposite of how a bad clutch feels  when the slave cylinder fails you can 146t get your truck out of gear  you can put a band aid on the problem by having someone  147bleed 148 your clutch line and get all the air out  eventually you 146ll need to fix it for good though  and it should cost between  250    350 to get it repaired gas mileage is surprisingly bad for my trooper  and i average 14 mpg  i was getting around 12 for most of the summer  until i put my tires up to their max air pressure  now i 146m getting closer to 17  with a few dips down to 13 or 14  this can 146t be considered good mileage by any means  and you don 146t get the power of a v8 that the mileage suggests you would  i attribute most of this to the lower gearing and aforementioned barn like aerodynamics  the last problem i must mention is the timing belt noise  if a trooper you own or one you are looking at has a loud clacking or tapping noise  it could be the timing belt tensioner  this is a common problem with these engines around 100k miles  and should be replaced whenever you have your timing belt replaced  the tensioner is a hydraulic dampened spring that keeps pressure on your timing belt  this removes any slack from the belt and prevents it from jumping on the pulleys  the hydraulic portion fails after so many miles  and causes the tensioner to cycle in and out rapidly  this can sound just like an engine bearing or rod slapping  but is significantly cheaper to repair  depending on labor costs  you are looking at  350 to  500 for timing belt and tensioner replacement b  final comments  b even though the above negatives may sound daunting  you must remember that every brand and model has their own chronic defects and failure areas  the isuzu 146s are usually very reliable  and if something fails it 146s usually a part that won 146t leave you stranded  if i had to do it all over again  i would still buy my trooper  even with its little quirks  i have enjoyed the storage and passenger capacity the trooper offers  there are several useful isuzu forums if you have questions about your trooper  although the isuzu dealer network is sorely lacking  i wouldn t say the trooper is for everyone  but i would give it a strong look along with the other suvs i have mentioned  the trooper pulls ahead of its competition in the areas of value and cargo space  check out the fanatics at the isuzu trooper owners guild if you want more info on troopers http www

13,camera, i really love this camera  i am a graphic designer who creates photo calendars  photo business cards  etc  playing with photos is my passion  but i always hated taking pictures and waiting until the roll was used up before i could develop them  then i had to wait another day for developing  finally  i had to scan the pictures into my computer before i could begin working on a photo project not so with my kodak dc215 zoom  i can take one picture  or 75 pictures at a time  the camera has a review screen  so that if a photo does not come out well it can be deleted immediately  no more developing over  or under exposed photos  at any point  i can plug the memory card into a mouse sized usb cf reader that transfers my pictures quickly and automatically into my computer  where they are ready to print we really enjoyed taking pictures after the birth of our daughter  and sending them by email to family and friends  the pictures printed beautifully as well here are some of the camera s specifications megapixel picture resolution  1152 x 864 pixels color lcd 4 flash modes  auto  fill  red eye  off 10 second self timer jpeg or flashpix image files optional date stamp etc it comes with the follwoing wriststrap and lenscap usb compactflash card reader compactflash removable memory camera specific software  as well as adobe photodeluxe and pagemill  and photo printer 2 0  photoshop for mac systems serial cable for windows  adapter for mac video cable batteries  quick set up guide  user s guide and registration card the camera also has lens kits and other accessories for purchase there are two minor drawbacks  after taking a photo  the camera takes a few seconds to process the image  so two photos cannot be taken quickly in succession  the camera also uses a lot of batteries  fortunately  rechargeables can be used with this camera  or you can buy an adapter to plug into an outlet  ,really love camera graphics designer create photo calendar photo business card etc play photo passion always hat take picture wait roll use could develop wait another day develop finally scan picture computer could begin work photo project today room take one picture picture time camera review screen photo come well delete immediately develop expose photo point plug memory card mouse size us cf reader transfer picture quickly automatically computer ready print really enjoy take picture birth daughter send email family friends picture print beautifully well camera specification megapixel picture resolution pip color lead flash modes auto fill red eye second self time peg flashpix image file optional date stamp etc come follow wriststrap lenscap us compactflash card reader compactflash removable memory camera specific software well adore photodeluxe pagemill photo printer photoshop mac systems aerial cable windows adapt mac video cable batteries quick set guide user guide registration card camera also lens kit accessories purchase two minor drawback take photo camera take second process image two photo take quickly succession camera also use lot batteries fortunately rechargeables use camera buy adapt plug outlet
14,camera, in this ever expanding digital world of ours  where free time is our most valuable commodity  one can get easily buried in the mass of information  specifications  pixelations and operations of the plethora of digital cameras that are available for many  where digital photography is a big part of their lives  choosing a suitable camera with a multitude of options and megapixels is a necessity  for others  who simply want to have fun taking pictures with a single  click  and easily upload those pictures to their pc for viewing printing emailing  the idea of spending hundreds of dollars on a camera they ll never fully exploit prohibited them from this digital realm but polaroid knew there was a market out there for a low cost  moderately functional digital camera that could be accessible to everyone  after initially coming out with their 320 model digital camera which  for  20  offered a very poor digital photo  they ve re thought their method and direction and have come out with the  fun  620 digital camera   the  fun  620 digital camera  offers twice the resolution of their earlier 320 model   producing images of 640 x 480 pixel resolution  in the megapixel world  that equates to about 1 3 of 1 megapixel  that being the case  the images are adequate for viewing on the screen  but they don t print out with any level of quality that you would receive with a 2 1 or better megapixel camera  but that s really not the purpose of the  fun  620 digital camera   it s more for having fun  emailing pictures  uploading them to your website and more  want good quality printable digital images  look elsewhere the  fun  620 digital camera  has few features  but what it does have works well  there s a 15 second self timer which is easy to use  the optical view finder seems to line up the image accurately  an lcd display indicates how many images you have taken  maximum of about 15  whether the memory is full  and whether there isn t sufficient light to properly expose the image  and  of course  there s a delete picture button which works on a 3 second delay  as to avoid accidental deletions the internal memory  1 megabyte  isn t removable like other digital cameras  so the only way to extract the pictures are to hook up the camera to your pc and dump them  connection to your pc is a snap with the included combination usb and serial port connector  included with the camera is the appropriate driver software to allow you to retrieve the pictures  saved as jpg files  additionally  there s a nice  moderately powerful  image viewing editing software called photomax  the low light indicator will still allow you to take a picture  however unless you have the camera mounted on a tri pod  or other stationary item  the image may come out fuzzy and or distorted  and since this camera doesn t come equipped with a flash  model 820 does  you ll want to insure the camera is steady in those low light situations  outdoors  in full light  the images are typically more vibrant and colorful   capturing a fair amount of details  colors and flesh tones all seem pretty accurate with a decent light source the casing of the  fun  620 digital camera  is made of a light weight  moderately durable silver plastic  for those of you who  like myself  equate heft in electronics with quality and durability  you ll know immediately that this camera does not contain either  a drop to the floor resulted in the battery compartment opening and the camera body itself splitting open  but everything snapped back together and the camera worked fine  so there is some durability here  additionally  the style and grip of the camera are both ergonomic and comfortable the  fun  620 digital camera  runs on 4 aa batteries  also included with the camera  and since there s no flash or color lcd display to drain their power  they should last for you hundreds of exposures  the auto off feature insures you don t drain the batteries unintentionally as well for around  30  the  fun  620 digital camera  offers a fair amount of features and performance  absent a flash and any zoom capabilities  this is a basic point and shoot digital camera that s a perfect way to break into the digital medium  or just play around with some low cost  fun digital photography the price certainly is right  and you get what you pay for thanks  as always  for

15,auto, ten years ago  when saturn opened its doors  few would have expected that the new company would be able to compete with the import cars that dominated the compact and subcompact world  well  by designing a reliable  value priced car  and a friendly hassle free atmosphere in their dealerships  they not only survived  they changed the automobile industry thanks to the reliability and lower cost of their vehicles  saturn has a fiercely loyal customer base  their problem in recent years has been that many of those customers had outgrown the compact car  and were looking for a midsize car  as one saturn owner put it  year after year  i visited the saturn showroom and asked   quot so  do you have a bigger car yet quot  year after year  the answer was   quot no  not yet quot those customers had little choice but to buy a honda  ford  or toyota  now  at the beginning of a new century  saturn has the daunting task of taking on some of the most popular vehicles in production today  the toyota camry  ford s taurus  and the honda accord  enter the new  bigger saturn l series  now car buyers have two more choices  the ls sedan and lw wagon  how good is the new saturn  were they able to design and produce a car that can compete in this group  we think they did very well  the new saturns deserve to be taken seriously by car buyers who are looking for a midsize car the l series may not turn heads with its understated styling  but it is sure to convince a lot of buyers with its features and price  under the hood  you ll find either the peppy new 2 2 liter balanced shaft 137 horsepower 4 cylinder dohc engine that will also be used soon in other gm cars  or the 3 liter 184 horsepower dohc v 6 that is also used in the opel omega  saab 9 5 and cadillac catera  driving the car  whether it s the standard 5 shift or the automatic 4 shift is fun  it may be made in america  but it kept much of its european pedigree  we were more than pleasantly surprised on country roads and highways  it smoothes bumps  takes corners and accelerates in an almost sports car fashion your family will find the interior to be very roomy in comparison to the other cars in the group  front leg room and head room are excellent  rear leg room is a little cramped  the large bucket seats are more comfortable than the old saturn seats  and four adults can easily take a trip in the l series  one of the comments we heard often from passengers was   quot are you sure this is a saturn quot the dash is clean and easy to understand  it only takes a few minutes before you are completely familiar with the buttons  information lights  and gauges  placement of the controls makes it easy for the driver to make on the fly changes the 60 40 split folding seats allow you to expand the trunk s over 17 cubic feet of cargo space  the lw wagon  has over 29 cubic feet of space which expands to over 70 cubic feet with the seats down one area that saturn has really improved on is the noise level of their l series cars  the s series cars were known to be very noisy  but that is not the case with the l series  the v 6 engine runs very quietly  and the 4 cylinder has only a slight  quot buzz quot  when you accelerate  the cabin is well sound proofed   only some wind noises on the highway  even the fan blows quieter that the fans on earlier saturns there s no question in our mind that the saturn has earned its place among the accords  camry s  and taurus s  but will it have any features that will allow it jump past the competitors  our answer is definitely   quot yes quot  after you ve looked at all the features  test drove the various cars  and checked out the dealers  there is one very important difference  the saturn l series costs a lot less  the base ls sedan starts at only  15 450  the ls1  at  17 190  the v6 powered ls2 model starts at  20 575  and the lw wagons start at a base price of  19 275  we think the saturn l series will give the other mid size family cars a real run for the money  your money that is  now  what can we do with that couple of thousand bucks we saved  kid s college education  trip to orlando  pay off some bills  wow  this is really fun br

16,camera, i have used other digital cameras  mavicas  and bought this one because it has a good list of features for a relatively low price  camera   32mb card   299us  dock   77us  although i am fairly proficient with cameras and electronica i also was attracted to kodak because i knew that my whole family would be able to use it with few problems  i love the still shots it takes  although the lag does seem a little long  i wish they would ve put a little rubber strip on the back for your thumb  as it feels like the camera s going to slip or get knocked out of your hand i couldn t get the install cd to work correctly on my win98 machine  and i finally went through the cd directory structure and installed the various bits manually  but after i did i have had no complaints  it is awesome to be able to set the full camera in its dock  press one button and have everything automatically upload to the computer  i love it i have upgraded the camera s internal firmware from the kodak website  and it went without a hitch  very easy  this did fix a frustrating problem with having low battery life  so now i only have one more complaint  which is the high resolution video quality  if the camera is set to take the best quality video  it will play over cable to your tv ok  but the mov s are choppy like crazy on the computer  once i set the video quality down to the smaller resolution my mov s now play well  although it s a tiny image  my computer is win98  400mhz  576 megs of ram  so i don t think my playback problems are computer related  but i m still searching for the answer on that one  ,use digital camera magical buy one good list feature relatively low price camera mb card us dock us although fairly proficient camera electronic also attract today know whole family would able use problems love still shots take although law seem little long wish would put little rubber strip back thumb feel like camera go slip get knock hand get install work correctly win machine finally go directory structure instal various bits mentally complaints awesome able set full camera dock press one button everything automatically unload computer love upgrade camera internal firmware today webster go without pitch easy fix frustration problem low battery life one complaint high resolution video quality camera set take best quality video play cable ok move happy like crazy computer set video quality smaller resolution move play well although tiny image computer win legs ram think playback problems computer relate still search answer one
17,auto, lured by zero interest rates i decided to buy a mini van in the  25 000  cnd range  i picked the caravan over the venture or windstar wanting to get the most up to date design unlock the van with a third party remote release and open the driver s door  it s an easy step up to the highback bucket seat with fixed head rest  standard budget model  the seat is firm  but the bolstering in sparse   no power functions  quality of materials is good  but plastiky the 3 3l v6 sparks up easily and revs quietly  the column mounted shifter drops the four speed automatic into drive with very minimal arm effort  shifter is almost too smooth  making it a bit too easy to drop it into low unintentionally gauges are on a nice white background  but are obscured for tall drivers when tilt steering is down too low  stalk mounted wiper switch turn signal works smoothly  rear view mirros are power adjustable both sides the caravan pulls away smartly  tranny shifts smoothly as speed climbs  steering is solid with little play  bumps in the road are muted but not silent  no interior rattles  doors auto lock at speed above 30kms   auto unlock when van is placed back in park squeeze the throttle and the engine roars louder than i d expect  acceleration is strong enough but runs out of steam above 4500 rpm  at 80kms the engine is turning over a lazy 1500 rpm  wind noise is noticeable at highway speeds but not bothersome non abs brakes have a firm pedal feel and strong stopping power  i have yet to attempt full lock up so i have no opinion about emergency stopping power  discs front  drums rear  all season tires are average quality  handling and braking would probably improve with lower  fatter profile tires six speaker single cd has surprising volume  but lacks true high fidelity   decent bass output  other controls are good  but legacy design of rear wiper buttons always require a look to find  don t understand why dodge has one button that kills all the climate control functions  fans are noisy even at the lowest setting  heat and cooling functions are fast and efficient pull over to let the kids out  both sliding doors open easily  access to two passenger middle seat is easy  but because seat back doesn t tilt  access to the rear most seat is tight and can only be accessed from passenger side rear hatch door is huge  but opens easily unlocking when the power locks are released from driver or passenger door  or keyless remote  since this is a short wheelbase caravan  the room behind the rear seat is tight  but is still useful due to its height  a row of hooks for plastic grocery bags prevents spills on the way back home  lots of luggage and full load of passengers may require rental or purchase of a roof luggage coffin  this model has a roof rack but is rated for only 150lbs seats are heavy   two seater middle  three seater rear  to remove and should be attempted with two people to avoid personal injury  they pop in and out easily once positioned over the floor latches  infant car seats tether to the rear of both benches easily  with the seats removed the carry capacity is excellent even for a relatively short vehicle  interior lighting is excellent front to back  but opera lighting  though quick to extinguish  is gimicky and annoying when you want to get away quickly in the dark  headlights illuminate well i cannot believe how many of this model of caravan are on the road  i guess a lot of other people found enough positive features and performance to pick one up too  ,lure zero interest rat decide buy mind van range

18,auto, hee un day  hund die  hi un day  hoon diey  150 buy yourself an accent and you re letting yourself in for a lifetime of tongue twisting action  according to my old next door neighbor  who happened to own the brand back in its gen  park cheobol prime  the correct pronunciation is  145hee un dae 146  but then this is the same man who told me that soju kettles weren 146t alcoholic  that the meat i was eating was duck and that the hyatt hotel was due for demolition any day  so who knows what i can say is that hyundai have come a long way since their re badged cortina leftover days and 1988 seoul sponsorship  i will never see another orange pony and not think flo jo  back then they were the cheapest transport you could imagine to get you from a to b with a minimum of fuss and comfort  they were 15 years ago what tata are today  minus the rover tie ins  and that was fine  korean prices helped korean cars sell and unlike american cars of the day they had the good sense not to explode when rear ended  these days they 146re still as cheap as christina aguillera after a few baileys but they 146re striving for two things that the pop strumpet fundamentally fails to understand  they 146re looking for a modicum of class and the respect that might go along with it  hyundai want to be about more than price  they want to be about more than value for inches  most of their cars are the biggest in their price range  and they want to be about more than 10 year   100 000 mile warranties  they want to be good cars  the nerve of these people of course anyone who wants to make good cars moves to europe and hyundai are no exception  which is where i have my first problem with the accent  you see the europeans like their hatchbacks  150 and the accent was designed to be a hatch  add the trunk necessary to shift any units in the us and suddenly you have something seriously ugly  it doesn 146t help that the transformation was done with the subtlety of a michael jackson surgeon  fully trunked this is a car that does not rest easy on the eye  150 not since the sedan version of the toyota echo have i seen anything as ungainly  and i 146ve seen the paris hilton sex tapes so the car fails the first test its set  150 looking awkward  foreign and  admit it  kinda cheap on the driveway  the tiny 13 148 wheels don 146t help  failing to fill the arches and shod  cinderella like  in a shoddy plastic  i have an very odd video only version of cinderella  okay climb inside and things get little better  not only is it ugly but  unlike a transsexual hooker  it 146s poorly equipped   10k  the price of a good brazilian female   male operation by the way  gets you a car with little more than a weedy radio   cassette player  a clock and as much shiny gray plastic as you could ever want  in defense of the car the dash is well screwed together and the radio is by sony  it 146s also a radio made for people who have small pointy compasses rather than person sized fingers  150 the buttons tiny and virtually impossible to pinpoint  that 146s my only real complaint  what controls there are seem to be logically placed and showed no sign of breaking off in my hand as i tugged at them start the car up and the 1 6l 16v engine sparks into life with a gruff but not unattractive note  hyundai 146s have always had a bit of poke and the accent is no 98 lb weakling 104hp and 106lbs of torque are more than adequate in a car this size  though to get to the maximum power you 146re going to have to rev a little harder than is comfortable  it 146s not at all bad though  a slightly raucous note giving it a edge of sportiness  the 5 speed manual box is sweeter than any i 146ve encountered from korea too  150 less notchy than you 146d imagine and positive in the throw  progress then is adequate if not swift and can be quite amusing if you 146re prepared to risk your eardrums and hold on for the red line  you 146re not going to be heal and toeing this one  150 but you feel as though you could  both pedals are well weighted and positive push hard on those brakes and the nose will dive  150 that 146s to be expected i suppose as is the body roll on less than tight corners  the skinny wheels give way a little early for my liking but then i drive somewhat more aggressively than the people for whom this car was intended and i 146m sure that under normal circumstance the whole thing is a decent balance of comfort and handling ability should it go wrong there are 4 airbags   you can disable the passenger one should you be carrying kids but again that 146s about it  150 active safety is woeful  i haven 146t seen crash test ratings but the car feels quite solid  i 146d wager it would do okay where the car plays its ace of course is with that warranty  150 a basic 5 yr  60 000 miles with roadside assistance to match  150 plus 10 years   100 000 miles on the drivetrain  it 146s the most remarkable thing about a car this unremarkable but then you get to thinking  with no revolutionary technology  no expensive bits and pieces and a minimum of wiring this is a car that 146s been tried and tested over the years  it 146s a simple package yes but it 146s one that works  servicing costs are low as are costs of running  insurance is peanuts and 33mpg isn 146t at all bad which leads me to the horses for courses part of the review  the hyundai accent is no looker and it 146s sparsely equipped but it does a job and it does that job well  it 146s cheap to buy  cheap to run and will keep going as long as you want to hold on to it  and for many people that 146s more than enough  utilitarian motoring may not have been the order of the day but for now it 146s do nicely  ,un day hand die hi un day soon die buy accent let lifetime

19,camera, have owned kodak digital cameras for nearly 4 years and have used them to take over 1500 pictures  my last camera was a kodak dc200  see reveiw  that i bought refurbished from kodak  i loved my camera  but as technology and times change  it was time for an upgrade  finding the right camera the main reason i wanted to upgrade was better resolution  my old camera was a 1 3 mega pixel camera and i wanted one that had a better resolution  i knew from previous experience that i wanted to zoom lens on my new camera  i did some research and found out that digital zoom is okay  but optical zoom is better  i also wanted a camera that used compact flash memory cards because i could use the old cards from my previous camera and it is so easy just to slap a new flash card in after you have filled one with pictures  a few more features that i wanted were a delay7 timer and the ability to attach the camera to a tripod  i ll be honest  i went to ebay and started looking and saw prices and features all across the spectrum  i then decided to go back to an old friend at the kodak refurbished digital camera section and found what i was looking for  the kodak dx 3600  the kodak dx 3600 2 2 mega pixel camera that has 2x optical zoom and 3x digital zoom  the camera has 8mb of internal storage and takes compact flash cards also  included are a delay timer  tripod adapter hole and a lcd screen  one big plus for the dx3600 was that the lens cap is built in  it was such a pain to remove the lens cap take your picture and then try and find the lens cap again with my old camera  i ve had the wind blow the lens cap away when i just set it down while taking a picture and had a child pick it up one time  i almost forgot to include that this camera can shoot small videos with audio in the quicktime format  likes this camera takes great pictures  the highest resolution is 1800x1200  the lowest is 900x600  i also like the zoom lens  the digital zoom is okay but the optical portion is great  i like the video abilities of the camera a lot  the high video resolution is 320x240 and the low resolution video is 160x120  i have used it to send short clips to each of my child s grandparents and they absolutely adore it  the lcd screen is easy to use and is adjustable so that it isn t on all the time to conserve battery life  the setup menu is so simple that a child could have the camera setup in minutes and start taking pictures  of course  this dx3600 also comes with red eye flash reduction  a programmable flash  and a close up setting for small close up pictures  the dx3600 downloads pictures very fast due to its usb int3erface  my old dc200 would take forever and this camera is very  very fast  dislikes unfortunately there are few things that i don t really care for on this camera  the camera has a funny feel to it  i believe that the camera feels funny due to it being rounded in the front and not flat like my old camera  another dislike is that kodak only wants you to use lithium or crv3 batteries in the camera  i ended up buying rechargeable lithium batteries that cost more than the alkaline rechargeable that was in the old camera  the biggest dislike is that kodak didn t design an a c adapter for this camera  kodak wants you to buy the easy share docking station to recharge the batteries and download the pictures at the same time  easy share docking station the easy share docking station hooks up to your computer via a usb cable that is supplied with your digital camera  a set of kodak rechargeable batteries are also included with the docking station to that when the dx3600 is placed into the docking station the batteries are recharged  one touch of a button and the pictures are downloaded into your computer  i use windows xp professional  see review  so i didn t load any of the kodak software onto my computer  i like the easy share concept  but the easy share docking station is way overpriced  kodak sells the docking station with a set of rechargeable batteries for  79 00  bottom line i really like the dx3600 more than i thought i would  the camera takes high quality pictures and video  buy the easy share docking station and an extra set of batteries and this will be a great setup for almost every household update newsflash 12 aug 02 i was looking at the kodak dx3600 on ebay and found out that kodak is selling the refurbished cameras on their ebay store and the price for the dx3600 was  199  i had paid  239 on the kodak on line store  i shot kodak an email asking for a refund of the difference of  40 and they said yes  if you want to buy this camera  kodak s ebay store is the place to look  ,own today digital camera nearly years use take picture last camera today see review buy refurbish today love

20,auto, first of all  this will not be a review containing horsepower information  0 to 60 stats  true gas mileage charts  etc  there are plenty of reviews out there that do a good job of covering that information  this is my female review of the 2002 chevy trailblzer  i knew i wanted my next car to be an suv  monitarily  i found myself looking into the mini suv market  i test drove the ford escape  the jeep liberty  the hyndai santa fe  etc  but somehow last feb  i found myself buying a 2002 chevy trailblazer  the 2002 chevy trailblazer is a completely new body design from general motors  they must have seen the need to compete with the explorer crowd and increase the size of the blazer  the trailblazer is in family of similar gm suv s  gmc  envoy  olds  bravada  buick  rainer  soon to come getting into the trailblazer  you feel like you are in a beast of a car  well coming from a pontiac grand am  you do  there is plenty of legroom in the front and back  something the mini suv s lack  the seats are big and comfortable  the dash isn t too over powering like some of the gm mini vans from the 80 s  you sit up pretty high now for the test drive  i had a limited exposure to full size suv s  i drove my friend s 2002 envoy  her nails where wet  and another friend s 2002 ford explorer  he was under the influence  so i was pretty much an suv virgin  it took a bit getting used to sitting up so high above everyone else  turning was also a huge issue  i felt as if i was going to tip over with every corner i took  luckily that feeling is now gone  and i haven t tipped it over i ve been told i m an aggressive driver   i like to get going as fast as possible  as soon as possible  here i am  in a huge suv with only a tiny v 6 engine  i ve always made sure my cars were atleast a v 6  my lovley 90  olds i drove in high school had a beefy v 8  now i d be lying if i said this thing flies off the line  don t try to race any mustangs  but overall it has the pick up i need for my driving style  now onto the 4x4 option  being in michigan  we splurged for the 4x4 ls version  never having a 4x4 before  i had no idea what to expect  most of this winter was snowless  so i didn t utilize the 4x4 much  but it did come in handy when we did use it  traveling back from the up at thanksgiving  we drove into a near white out  my husband flipped the tb  as we call it  into awd and took off  no slipping  no sliding  to test it we flipped off the 4x4 and definetly saw the difference the ls version of the trailblazer comes with some nice features  the cd radio is decent  with no speakers in the rear storage area  you can t get the car  bumpin  but it fits our needs 99  of the time  i love the dual climate control  my husband can bust into a sweat when it s 10 degrees outside  where as i can have goose bumps when it s 70  so having the ability to control our own heat ac is nice  3 cup holders in the front  is a feature i love  having only one cup holder in the 99  grand am  makes you really apperciate 3   the 2 cigarette lighters  well one lighter  one port  make it convient to be charging a cell phone and running a radar detector  the large map pockets on the door are handy for storing cd s  maps  papers  books  etc  the middle console  or hoofer as we call it  is nice and deep for lots of storage  it also has grooves for holding cd s if you prefer the middle row of seats have their own features too  there are an additional 2 cup holders that flip down onto the  hump  the middle seats also have their own climate control panel and cigarette  port  the middle row seats flip in a 40 60 split making it convient to haul boxes  skis  bookcases  10  trees  etc  done all of them  there is also a small amount of storage available under the seats the rear cargo area is nice and roomie  it features a  hidden  storage compartment  there are also to side storage compartments  the rear cargo area also has the 4th cigarette  port  the back hatch has strap to add in pulling it down  from inside or out  the back hatch also has the option of just opening the rear window  the back window also has a rear wiper  one thing my ls did not come with but we added on later is remote keyless entry  i strongly suggest you get that option  the rear hatch can only unlock by key  to lock the hatch you have to use the car s main locks  very annoying here i sit  one year and 30 000 miles later and i m still as in love with my tb  like i said  i was pricing mini suv s at the time  so getting something like the tb  with as much as it offers was a great surprise  after the gm discount  thanks uncle tim and mom  and the  2500 in rebates  we drove off the lot with a 2002 chevy trailblazer ls 4x4 for the same price as a ford escape 4x2  ,first review contain horsepower

21,camera, i have been posting images to the internet for a couple of year now and it was always the same old routine  buy film  take the pictures  and hope for the best  have the film processed  scan the acceptable shots into the computer and then upload them to the web  to me it didn t seem like the best way to handle the steps  so i started looking at digital cameras my main objective was to find a decent camera at a very reasonable price   my choice the kodak dc200 plus the dc200plus comes with the following features megapixel picture resolution   1152 by 864 pixels point and shoot auto exposure focal range from 27 inches to infinity 4 megs of memory on the card provided serial connection to your computer uses 4aa batteries tripod mount video out connection for hook up to tv or vcr self timer i know this may sound a little overwhelming if you have never used a digital camera before   but it s a great little camera  i took over 400 picture in a three month period and i have found it very useful for internet imaging the thing that i find most useful is the instant access to the picture  if i take a picture  i look at the preview   if i like it  i keep it  if i don t i delete it and try again  this way the only images i store in the camera are the one s that i plan to use   it beats processing a 36 exposure roll and only being able to use four or five one thing that i do is that i still keep my 35mm handy   if i take a picture with the digital camera and it looks good on the preview   i take out the 35mm and commit an image to film  this way if i take something that i eventually want to have enlarged i will have a higher quality negative to work with the images produced by the camera are also printable   but i would not recommend enlarging them to anything larger than a 5 by 7  but they are very functional for the internet the transfer to the pc is very acceptable and the software that comes with the camera does a very good job printing the images i have updated the firmware in the camera once since i purchased it  it was very easy   download the software   connect the camera   run the software   boom  it s done what it lacks the camera is a battery hog  buy rechargeable batteries and a charger the memory card should have been larger   if you use the standard resolution  the camera will hold about 35 images  in the highest setting the camera will only hold about 9 kodak should have included an ac adapter with the camera the view hole  if you call it that  doesn t line up with the lens of the camera  this takes a little getting used to  but it should not stop you from purchasing the camera overall   a good camera for the beginning digital user  the cost is right and the camera is very user friendly to see sample images check out http web dbtech net jp532 br br  ,post image internet couple year always old routine buy film take picture hope best film process scan acceptable shots computer unload web seem like best way handle step start look digital camera main objective find decent camera reasonable price choice today plus plus come follow feature megapixel picture resolution pip point shoot auto exposure local range inch infinity legs memory card provide aerial connection computer use batteries try mount video connection hook ver self time know may sound little overwhelm never use digital camera great little camera take picture three month period find useful internet imagine thing find useful instant access picture take picture look review like keep delete try way image store camera one plan use beat process exposure roll able use four five one thing still keep mm handy take picture digital camera look good review take mm commit image film way take something eventually want enlarge higher quality negative work image produce camera also printable would recommend enlarge anything larger functional internet transfer pp acceptable software come camera good job print image update firmware camera since purchase easy download software connect camera run software boom do lack camera battery buy rechargeable batteries charge memory card larger use standard resolution camera hold image highest set camera hold today include ac adapt camera view hole call line lens camera take little get use stop purchase camera overall good camera begin digital user cost right camera user friendly see sample image check http web dutch net br
22,camera, i was searching for a digital camera that i could afford  i never expected that i could get one of this caliber  the dc215 zoom millenium edition takes big 1152x864 res  great quality pictures  it comes with more memory than most cards offer  8mb which can fit 26 of the highest quality and highest resolution pictures possible  and it even includes the memory card reader so you don t have to transfer your pictures slowly through the included cable  it has 2x optical zoom  which means you can zoom 2x without losing any quality as in digital zoom  the millenium edition also comes with a cord to hook up the camera to your tv to view the pictures on a big screen  other digital cameras that i looked at with most of these features were  400  the only things bad about this camera is that there is a kind of a long delay between shots and the batteries are usually used before your second fill of shots  but this can be remedied by buying the ac adapter and or rechargeable batteries br br  ,search digital camera could afford never expect could get one calibre room millennium edition take big yes great quality picture come memory card offer mb fit highest quality highest resolution picture possible even include memory card reader transfer picture slowly include cable optical room mean room without lose quality digital room millennium edition also come cord hook camera view picture big screen digital camera look feature things bad camera kind long delay shots batteries usually use second fill shots remedied buy ac adapt rechargeable batteries br
23,auto,  introduction  i m rating my friends 1990 454ss this is an amazing truck  my friend bought it a few months ago and it was fast then  since then  he s put about  3 000 in engine mods into it and its incredibly fast now b pro s  it is a chevy  so it has an excellent maintenance record  he s had to change the oil a few times and replace the distributor  other than that  he has done thing but cosmetic and performance mods to it  if you need to do anything under the hood  there is plenty of space  even with the 7 4 liter engine it is really comfortable for two people  giving lots of leg and arm room  the seats are entitled   quot sport quot  and they hold the occupant well  they don t look like they wrap around a lot  but they definitely hold you in your place  it originally came with a center console  but the previous owner got rid of it  he has since added a center pad  and even with three people  there is lots of room  although not too safe  since he didn t add a seat belt throttle response is amazing  easily spinning the tires below twenty miles an hour  it came with a shift kit  so the shifts are aggressive and will squeal the tires in second gear it is faster than 90  of cars out there  faster than all but the mustang cobra gt in the ford line up of today  and much faster than lightening s of its period  it has a heavy duty drive train to stand up under 450 ft  lbs  of torque or more this truck turns better than any full size chevy i ve ever seen  i don t know if it is part of the sport setup or just a good year for chevy steering  but you can do a u tun in less than two lanes part of this sport package is the size of the brakes  this truck will stop on a dime  stopping is much better than i ve seen in other trucks that weigh the same amount  even some smaller cars trucks don t stop as well chevy rigged up a line lock for the owner  press the gas and brake at the same time and watch the tires light up in smoke b neutral  this truck was only offered with a three speed automatic transmission  this limits top speed to 114 governed so the engine doesn t blow up  the three speed is the th400e  which by car fanatics terms means it is very strong and hard to damage  one of the only ones that will handle all of the trucks torque this truck only comes in single cab short bed  no problem  especially if you just use it for racing  if you need to move more than one friend around it can get cumbersome turning a truck will never be as fun as turning a car  the top heavy 454ss is not a road course truck by any means  for around  500 you can lower it and greatly improve your turning odds this truck does not come with four wheel drive  after all  why should it  you don t need a truck that is this fast off road i love the seats  my friend says he thinks they make is back sore  may be the lack of lumbar  add a pillow to fix this b cons  it gets terrible gas mileage  the racing transmission has only three gears  which drops the gas mileage to 11 3 on the highway  and the top speed just shy of 115 miles per hour chevy paint never holds up very long  it was chipping very badly before he got it painted  it developed a gentle oil leak before we changed the oil  but it is gone now its 450 some odd lbs  of torque make it easy to spin the tires  no matter what the pavement is like  which wears the tires quickly insurance is very high  especially for a sixteen year old average student b variations  the 1990 454ss only comes in black  it is a very attractive black and the truck looks great  the 1990 also comes with the th400e transmission in 1991 1993 the truck was offered in black  white and red  it had a 4l80e  which is a four speed computer controlled th400e  but with a different gearing in the differential  the 1991 93 trucks get the same gas mileage you may see trucks that sport   quot 350 ss quot  they are not real trucks  chevy did not make them  some are just stickers  while others have real performance modifications like blowers and nitrous b overall  if you want a truck that is incredibly fast  aggressive and fun  this is the truck for you  but  don t expect to just pay the sticker price  expect at least  50 a month in gas  and at least  100 a month in insurance  of course  to get it really moving  you ll need some headers and other modifications  but even stock it is a really fast truck if you need a truck to tow extremely heavy things  the 454ss will do it without even groaning  you ll have a hard time damaging the drive train by over torquing or overworking the transmission don t expect to take it off road  and expect anyone in a slightly sporty car to want to race br br  ,introduction rat friends amaze truck friend buy months ago fast since put engine mode incredibly fast pro

25,auto, i got my 1995 chevy prizm  formerly known as the geo prizm  towards the end of 1996  i chose the car after exhaustive research amongst cars in its category  specifically looking for reliability  i know nothing about cars and engines  so naturally i was looking for something trouble free and value  based on experience  i m personally skewed towards japanese imports  toyota or honda and the likes  because i wasn t willing to pay much money for any car  i settled for the best value available  the prizm  which has chevy body  american built body  and toyota corolla engine having had the car for more than 3 years  i cannot give out enough praises for it  it has been very very reliable  knock on wood  the only shop visits i made was to the jiffy lube guys to change the oil and do other standard maintenance  boy  this car has endured so much with me  come to think of it  it s coming with me rain or shine  it doesn t mind to my swears and yells  i got the real basic prizm  the one with 1 6 liter engine and nothing else  literally  no automatic this or that  i adore 5 speed manual transmission  and i don t mind cranking the handle to open the window  so what i got was perfect for me  i have to admit that the seats could have been a little fluffier  i only feel this when doing long distance driving  above 5 hours  the power and handling are also marginal  but good enough for my purposes  the interior is decently roomy for me  probably because of my smallish frame  the outer body wasn t made of the strongest steel available  but i wasn t looking for tank either all said  i think this is a car for someone like me  a person with no knowledge about engines  other than basic maintenance  doesn t want to spend too much on a car  but wants a reliable vehicle to bring him from point a to point b  this is definitely not for those who are looking for status symbol or a muscle car everything considered  i am a happy camper with my prizm  i still have it and probably will stick with it for a couple more years     ,get prize formerly know go prize towards end choose car exhaustive research amongst cars category specifically look reliability know nothing cars engines naturally look something trouble free value base experience personally sew towards japanese import tooth hand like will pay much money car settle best value available prize body american build body tooth coolly engine car years give enough praise reliable knock wood shop visit make fifty tube gun change oil standard maintenance boy car endure much come think come rain shine mind swear yell get real basic prize one later engine nothing else literally automatic adore speed manual transmission mind crack handle open window get perfect admit seat could little tuffier feel long distance drive hours power handle also marginal good enough purpose interior decently room probably smallish frame outer body make strongest steel available look tank either say think car someone like person knowledge engines basic maintenance want spend much car want reliable vehicle bring point point definitely look status symbol muscle car everything consider happy hamper prize still probably stick couple years

27,camera, first off  i know precious little about photography  if you re looking to read about specs and the nuances of digital photography  read the reviews from people who know what they re talking about  all i know is that this camera is durable  easy to use and results in beautiful color prints  so if you  like me  just want to pick up a little camera and be able to successfully operate it  then the powershot s230 is probably a wise choice the size is perfect  small enough to fit into a purse or pant pocket  i ve hauled this camera across country and barely known it s there  the battery life is decent  with pretty regular use i seldom need to recharge it  when it does need juicing up  the charge doesn t take but an hour or so  without using the manual i was able to figure out the general controls  battery port location and remove replace the memory card  so this may be a bad sign for someone who is looking for a camera loaded with features  it does have an  outdoor  setting and red eye reduction  among other features  but basically i just turn it on  point and shoot  there is a small button on the back of the camera to select  movie  mode  the playback screen or adjust the setting to take regular pictures  i rarely use the movie mode  as i d prefer to use my old time y video movie camera for that sort of thing  but it i have used it and the picture is decent  i had a hard time adjusting to using it for the movie setting  as the camera is so tiny and it just felt strange for me to film that way after being used to lugging around a five pound vhs home movie camera  i prefer using it as a straight digital camera  it is very simple to erase a picture you don t want  even though you won t be erasing much as just about every photo captured is worth saving  when i grow more confident with my skill  i plan to pursue the other settings this camera has to offer  i do know that in the hands of a person far from being an expert  i was able to capture the moment and not miss a shot  on a recent trip to the oregon coast  i was tickled pink to see that the canon perfectly captured the turquoise of the water without missing a beat  little old me was actually able to take those  postcard  shots and have some bragging rights when i got home  removing the memory card is super simple and it s a one step process to attach to my mac  downloading was a snap and i didn t have to buy any extra software to view the photos on my desktop i realize this review isn t too helpful to people looking for thorough information  but if you just want to start with an affordable  yet quality camera i can t see the canon letting you down  in the hands of this idiot it did just what it should do  it worked  beautifully  ,first know precious little photography look read speck glance digital photography read review people know talk know camera unable easy use result beautiful color print like want pick little camera able successfully operate powershot probably wise choice size perfect small enough fit purse part pocket haul camera across country barely know battery life decent pretty regular use seldom need charge need judge charge take hour without use manual able figure general control battery port location remove replace memory card may bad sign someone look camera load feature outdoor set red eye reduction among feature basically turn point shoot small button back camera select movie mode playback screen adjust set take regular picture rarely use movie mode prefer use old time video movie camera sort thing use picture decent hard time adjust use movie set camera tiny felt strange film way use lag around five pound vs home movie camera prefer use straight digital camera simple ease picture want even though ease much every photo capture worth save grow confident skill plan pursue settings camera offer know hand person far expert able capture moment miss shoot recent trip oregon coast tickle pink see canon perfectly capture turquoise water without miss beat little old actually able take postcard shots brag right get home remove memory card super simple one step process attach mac download snap buy extra software view photo desktop realize review helpful people look thorough information want start unfordable yet quality camera see canon let hand idiot work beautifully
28,camera, if you are looking for a 3  megapixel camera  which is what experts seem to be recommending as the minimum for truly film quality images  then strongly consider this model or the kodak dx3700  which are the cheapest in this megapixel class  the dx3700 has fewer bells and whistles and cheaper by about  100  so i agonized over paying extra for the dx3900  but i m extremely happy with it nonetheless  the autofocus is the best i ve had on any point and shoot camera  extremely accurate under all light conditions weather your standing in the moon light or under a bright sun  i find there are few wasted shots  even with the luxury of being able to delete the bad ones  there seem to be only two meaningful differences between the cameras   1  the dx3700 zoom is only digital  i e  electronic  but the dx3900 zoom is both digital and  optical  so the physical lens also has a zoom  which seems to be more accurate and reliable in quality than digital zoom  and  2  the dx3700 has 8mb internal storage plus buy your own removable smart media cards  which apparently are favored in japan europe  while dx3900 has no internal mb and buy your own removable compactflash cards  which are used more in usa  but price per megabyte  mb  storage is virtually the same  approx   1 mb  for either medium  clearly  if you have a limited budget  the dx3700 is the best bang for your buck since it produces the same quality of pictures  but with next cheapest camera in the 3  megapixel class currently around  500  even the dx3900 remains a good deal if you want a better zoom and or this particular storage medium   in practice  i have found that the combination of the digital and optical zoom  total 6x  allows for greater flexibility in picture taking and i suspect the digital zoom alone on the dx3700  only 3x  would have been less useful  if you take personal photos for posterity this affects photo quality as much as the number of pixels and should be an important consideration  other pluses  the dx3900 is extremely lightweight  but not flimsy  which had worried me  with memories of the old brownie cameras  indeed  it s small enough to carry in my shirt pocket  it s also a sleek  good looking camera  with a lens that automatically retracts into a covered door to protect the lens when you turn the camera power on and off  a useful feature for the careless like me  don t bother with the proprietary docking station  which is just a plastic tray for  70  the docking station is supposed to be one touch no brainer transfer of photos to your computer  but it takes just as much work to figure out the tray as to simply connect the camera to your computer with a wire  the storage of pictures on the 8meg card that comes with the camera  it holds 7 pics at 3 1 megapixels  15 at 3 1 high compressed  10 at 2 2 megapixels  13 pics at 1 6 megapixels  and 23 at  8 megapixel shots  i plan on purchasing the viking cf128meg card  as this is the best buy for the compact flash that i have seen  they could have made this camera at least 2  larger and the lcd viewer is also small  downloading 25 50 pictures seemed to take a minute or less to my computer  which i think is relatively miraculous  the kodak software you use to view and manipulate the pictures is easy to use  kodak is the disney or macdonalds of the photo world and i think even my mom could figure it out  best feature is the one that lets you save in different formats for e mailing  a real time saver when you want to share photos with others electronically  also don t let anyone tell you that you need to replace the kodak paired batteries that come with the camera with kodak ones  you can use other brands of aa batteries  although the manual says they need to be 1 2 volt  i e  rechargeable variety  and not the standard 1 5 volt  non rechargeable  kind  there s little reason not to be rechargeable anyway  which are more cost effective  in a few years  you ll no doubt be able to buy 4 or 5 megapixel cameras for the same price  but from what i ve read  beyond 3 megapixels  you can t really tell the difference except at huge enlargment sizes  i e  bigger than 8x11  and most snapshots are only 4x6 or maybe 5x7  so what would be the point  so  in sum  this is a very good camera value if you don t want to let once in a lifetime moments slip away while you wait for prices on film quality 3 megapixel camera prices to drop  yet you don t want to spend what canon  nikon and others are charging  500  ,look megapixel camera experts seem recommend minimum truly film quality image strongly

31,camera, we have had our sony mavica for a year and a half  i have used a number of digital cameras and we tried out even more in the shops in tokyo before we bought it the best feature has to be the disk drive   no need to worry about running out of some expensive little memory stick   just buy a new box of disks  in fact we did run out of disks on our trip to the grand canyon but we figured we weren t far from somebody with a pc  we managed to persuade the helicopter operator company to sell us a box of disks get home and immediately stick the disk in and upload view the images  the camera creates a simple html file as an index to the images so it s easy to flick through them at a friends house  no worries   they re bound to have a pc and of course it s got a floppy drive  no problem showing your last few days of pics to them i have a friend back in the uk that actually takes his pc on his ski trips with him  just  so that he can download pictures from his digital camera  no need with the mavica another great feature is the big screen on the back of the camera  it continuously updates when you are framing a shot  this doesn t sound like much but it is so much easier to use than certain other cameras which only update every second or so  i m convinced that the screen display is the reason that our four year old can take perfect pictures with this camera  it also means that you don t have to have one eye on the scene and another on the screen the image quality is superb in good light  we have found it doesn t take the best night shots   there is a powerful flash but it can be a little overpowering sometimes if you are an slr buff moving to digital  you would definitely want to move up the mavica range from the fd81  however for any vacation family shots or taking pics for display on the web  selling on ebay etc  i d recommend the fd81 the battery life is very good  better still  it always tells you how many minutes you ve got left  on vacation  it usually lasts us a few days taking photos and movies every day br br  ,sonya mavra year half use number digital camera try even shop tokyo buy best feature disk drive need worry run expensive little memory stick buy new box disk fact run disk trip grand canyon figure far somebody pp manage persuade helicopter operator company sell us box disk get home immediately stick disk unload view image camera create simple html file index image easy flick friends house worry bind pp course get floppy drive problem show last days pick friend back actually take pp ski trip download picture digital camera need mavra another great feature big screen back camera continuously update frame shoot sound like much much easier use certain camera update every second convince screen display reason four year old take perfect picture camera also mean one eye scene another screen image quality superb good light find take best night shots powerful flash little overpower sometimes sir buff move digital would definitely want move mavra range ff however vacation family shots take pick display web sell bay etc recommend ff battery life good better still always tell many minutes get leave vacation usually last us days take photo move every day br

33,auto, after driving all the mini vans on the market  reading all the articles  surfing the net for user comments  like here  and talking to real kia mechanics  i bought the kia sedona ex  all options for  21 500  the dealer even threw in 3 years of oil changes i only have a couple hundred miles on the van  but everything is perfect  no rattles  no squeaks  no problems  it drives great and is very quiet on the road   i will report any problems in the future  as a service to those who are in the market for a minivan  i offer the following to consider 1  there is really no question about the value of the sedona when comparing it to the other minivans  you would have to pay  7 000 to  10 000 extra to get a comparable mini van from honda  toyota  dodge    2  the only real question mark concerns the quality and reliability of the sedona  to address this issue  kia offers the best warranty on the market  to put my mind at ease  i also talked to 3 different mechanics  from 3 different dealers  and they all said the same thing the sedona is the first vehicle kia has produced that meets the japanese in terms of initial quality and reliability   the kia cars are getting better  but still have room for improvement  in addition  none of the mechanics saw any consistent repair problems   yet  two of the mechanics thought that if there would be a problem it could be in the area of brakes  the fact the sedona weighs 500 800 pounds more than other mini vans may require more frequent replacement of the brake pads  the other mechanic thought that the kia engineers would have designed  beefier  brakes to accommodate the extra weight  i guess only time will tell fyi   for those of you who may be wondering about the honda odyssey  magic  third row seats that fold into the floor consider this  your only option with the third row of seats is  all or none  what does this mean in the real world  well  my neighbor has an odyssey and we were going to travel with 5 people and lots luggage  which required the removal of seats to accommodate the luggage  the problem with the odyssey  magic seat  is if you make them disappear  so does seating for 3 people  so you are left with lots of room for luggage  but seating for only 4 people   of course you could remove 1 of the middle row chairs for luggage storage  but this is inconvenient placement of the luggage and 2 people have to sit in the less comfortable third row of seats  with my sedona  i just removed one of the third row seats and we were ready to go a comfortable chair for each of the 5 adults and room for the luggage in the back  where it belongs  if kia were smart  they would introduce a split  magic  seat on their next van  ,drive mind van market read article surge net user comment like talk real kit mechanics buy kit second ex option dealer even throw years oil change couple hundred miles van everything perfect battle squeaky problems drive great quiet road report problems future service market midian offer follow consider really question value second compare minivans would pay extra get comparable mind van hand tooth dodge real question mark concern quality reliability second address issue kit offer best warranty market put mind ease also talk different mechanics different dealers say thing second first vehicle kit produce meet japanese term initial quality reliability kit cars get better still room improvement addition none mechanics saw consistent repair problems yet two mechanics think would problem could area rake fact second weigh pound mind van may require frequent replacement brake pad mechanics think kit engineer would design beecher rake accommodate extra weight guess time tell foi may wonder hand odyssey magic third row seat fold floor consider option third row seat none mean real world well neighbor odyssey go travel people lot luggage require removal seat accommodate luggage problem odyssey magic seat make disappear seat people leave lot room luggage seat people course could remove middle row chair luggage storage inconvenient placement luggage people sit less comfortable third row seat second remove one third row seat ready go comfortable chair adults room luggage back belong kit smart would introduce split magic seat next van
34,camera, there s no question about it  this camera will be a little bit of an investment  however  we re not photographers  and we re pleased as punch with this camera  picture quality is far superior to my 35 mm  and the ease with which you can transfer pictures to the computer makes this a great choice  the only drawback is that  because it s so expensive  we don t want to take it along on trips where it might get stolen or broken i ve taken pictures in the dark before  just hoping i was aiming in the right direction  and the pictures turned out great  the zoom is wonderful  we ve taken pictures about an acre away  and the subject looks like it s right in front of the camera   with no degradation  memory capacity is wonderful   just get a memory card with the capacity that you need  the flash works great in any light  battery life is acceptable  we just buy rechargeable batteries so that we can have spares on hand the only problem that we ve encountered is when we first got the camera  we took a bunch of pictures  deleted some that we didn t want  and then took some more  later  when we transferred the pictures to the computer  we discovered that the later pictures  though they existed on the camera  couldn t be seen by the computer  customer support was nonexistent  they didn t even call us back  but we discovered that it was because we didn t reinitialize the memory card before taking pictures  now  whenever we delete any pictures  we reinitialize the memory card before doing anything else  this means that we need to transfer the existing photos onto the computer first  so if you re going to be taking a lot of pictures at one time  it would be best to have a lot of memory cards on hand  but since we discovered this  we haven t had any problems  ,question camera little bite investment however photographer please punch camera picture quality far superior mm ease transfer picture computer make great choice drawback expensive want take along trip might get steal break take picture dark hop aim right direction picture turn great room wonderful take picture acre away subject look like right front camera degradation memory capacity wonderful get memory card capacity need flash work great light battery life acceptable buy rechargeable batteries spar hand problem encounter first get camera take bunch picture delete want take later transfer picture computer discover later picture though exist camera see computer customer support nonexistent even call us back discover reinitialize memory card take picture whenever delete picture reinitialize memory card anything else mean need transfer exist photo onto computer first go take lot picture one time would best lot memory card hand since discover problems
35,camera, after writing a review of the minilux  this is my second one  i sold my minilux last summer to buy a contax g2  probably will be my next review  i wanted to go digital for a couple of years and found the quality so so and prices fairly high  anyhow  i bought this leica 4 3 before christmas and i carry it everywhere  small  easy to use and it takes great pictures  it s fun to use and you download the pictures in your computer it s a different way to photograph  kind of polaroid on steroids  you can do an 80sec of video  which is kind of fun  i bought the leica  i should say fuji revised  because it s a fuji with leica dressing it up and for those who know leica  when they dress up they are pretty good at it at maximum definition  you get 18 pictures with the card and probably zillions at a low definition  what s the use if definition is lousy  you can get cards with more memory but if you have a computer  you just have to download them and start again  it takes 2 batteries aa rechargable it doesn t replace 35mm for me because i like b   w and i like to have prints of 16 x 20 or 11 x 14  optics are ok  but it s not so great for shooting architecture  to me it adds up to your regular photo equipment  i compared the fuji to the leica  the finish of the fuji is not as nice  less memory  cheaper software but about 300  less  being a digital camera  it s not an investment in the sense of the regular m6 or all the other m s  in a year or so  a new one will come on the market with 6 or 8 million pixels and my toy will be obsolete  but for the time being  it s a pretty cool camera with lots of features that i probably will never use  time will tell what i like of this company  i don t work for them or even in that business is that they come up with really cool tools  on one end you ll get the o leica which takes you back to the 1920s and you have digital  it seems that 30  of the company is now owned by hermes  luxury brand  i hope that they won t play too much with the lineup  ostrich elephant skin gold stopwatch cdplayer goes with your shoes point and shoot camera cool camera  nice design  easy to use  expensive but they have a really nice logo  ,write review minimum second one sell minimum last summer buy contact probably next review want go digital couple years find quality price fairly high anyhow buy lice christmas carry everywhere small easy use take great picture fun use download picture computer different way photograph kind polaroid steroids see video kind fun buy lice say full revise full lice dress know lice dress pretty good maximum definition get picture card probably millions low definition use definition louse get card memory computer download start take batteries rechargable replace mm like like print optic ok great shoot architecture add regular photo equipment compare full lice finish full nice less memory cheaper software less digital camera investment sense regular year new one come market million pip toy obsolete time pretty cool camera lot feature probably never use time tell like company work even business come really cool tool one end get lice take back digital seem company own heroes luxury brand hope play much line ostrich elephant skin gold stopwatch player go shoe point shoot camera cool camera nice design easy use expensive really nice log

37,camera, overall i like the camera  but 2 annoyances really keep me from giving the camera 4 stars  in fact  they are so severe that they bump it down to the 1 or 2 star range  i bought the camera for its mpeg vx 640x480 movie mode  so more on that later i ll guess that most of the readers here will know the basic spec s and features of the dsc p8  so i ll focus on some things that might not be so well known the most aggravating feature the macro button alone is responsible for more wasted shots than any other flaw in a camera of mine  i count this as the third generation of the cybershot p series  and the last two have have the same bewildering placement of the macro button  it is too close to where you would naturally place your thumb  what s worse is the fact that the macro button is rather prominent and just far too easy to inadvertently activate  it was a problem on the dsc p7   p9 and sony has just made it worse by making the button even taller than it was before on the p8   p10   p12 this is just so stupid  there can t be that many people using macro mode to justify making this the most likely button to get activated on the camera  yes  it s even easier to hit than the shutter release button exposure it s a point and shoot camera and it should do snapshots well  but it just doesn t  like the dsc p7 that i previously owned  this camera seems to get the exposure wrong more than i like  too often  the camera overexposes the subject s face into an unrecognizable white blob  other times  it flat out guesses in the opposite direction by leaving the subject completely dark  i ve tried both spot and matrix metering to no avail what is disappointing about all this is that my old dsc p1 seemed to get exposure right more often  my recommendation is to shoot lots of pic s and bracket as much as possible  unlike the dsc 10  the p8 does not auto bracket so you have to do this manually movies in early 2003  only a rare few digital cameras had unlimited movie  with sound  recording modes  sony s on the other hand have been offering this feature for over a year now  now that it is mid 2003  more cameras are emerging with unlimited recording time  limited of course only by the memory card size  with this feature becoming more commonplace  there are fewer reasons to buy a sony here s the skinny on the new mpeg vx 640 x 480 movie recording mode  it doesn t look any better than 320x240 movies the mpeg vx mode is an interpolated mpeg hqx 320x240  and trust me i have tried and tried and tried to look for any difference between the vx and hqx  320x240  or even hq  also 320x240  movies  there just simply isn t any discernable difference  i ve even done back to back comparisons between the three  using a dsc p1 and dsc p9  and i have yet to find any difference the most compelling evidence of interpolation is that the recording times for a 128mb memory stick are identical for mpeg hqx and mpeg vx i dislike the memory stick  geeeez  who likes to pay two to four times as much as everybody else is paying for the same size memory  let s see  after rebates 256mb memorystick    50 256mb compactflash    28 1gb memorystick    480  yikes 1gb compactflash    160 i dislike the wrist strap sony really cheaped out on this  previous dsc p1 p7 p9 had a nice wrist strap with a sliding collar that secured the camera to your wrist  the p8 has a flimsy strap that is missing the collar  there s no secure way to carry the camera now  i just don t understand why this would be missing some things that i do like it s small it s tough burst 2 mode is especially nice for capturing shots of kids  kids never sit still  ,overall like camera annoyance really keep give camera star fact severe bump star range buy camera peg movie mode later guess readers know basic

42,auto, i love the humvee  my experience though is limited to the military version  which is a heavier more rugged one  with bulletproof doors and windows  the humvee is simply the best vehicle on the market if you decide you want to drive over  or through something  completely water tight you can drive through a river and as long as the air stack is above the water line  you can breathe  it is like a big snorkel the humvee is as wide as it is tall  this was designed to prevent the roll overs that was the problem with the army jeep the humvee can accept the standard m60 machine gun  a 50 cal machine gun  a 40mm automatic grenade launcher  or a missle launcher  it also has towing capabilities  in case you decide to tow a 135mm cannon behind you  you can never have enough things to blow stuff up with  road rage   just try to mess with the hummer the only two annoying things about the hummvee is the horrid acceleration times it has  and pathetic gas mileage oh yeah  and cost almost 70 to 85 thousand for a truck the government pays under 30thousand each for  you get a cd player  the government gets missles  who gets the better deal  update  13 people who visited and didn t rate this i m going to have to find me a missle launcher  at least click on something  don t just leave  if you thought this stunk  rate it so br br  ,love humble experience though limit military version heavier rugged one bulletproof doors windows humble simply best vehicle market decide want drive something completely water tight drive river long air stick water line breathe like big snort humble wide tall design prevent roll problem army deep humble accept standard machine gun cal machine gun mm automatic grenade launch missile launch also owe capabilities case decide tow mm cannon behind never enough things blow stuff road rage try mess summer two annoy things hum horrid acceleration time pathetic gas mileage oh yeah cost almost thousand truck government pay thousand get player government get missiles get better deal update people visit rate go find missile launch least click something leave think sink rate br
43,auto, one of the most dramatic changes in the 2003 4runner must be the highly evolved body contours  at last the 4runner has moved beyond  trucklike  into a stylish multi purpose vehicle  my last car was a mercedes ml 320 and through it i got to know every single technician in the dealers service department  mainly because of numerous rattles and part failures which required continuous visits back and forth to service  i didn t want to go through that again  so i focused my attention on three well rated vehicles  the honda pilot  and the toyota highlander and 2003 4runner  i test drove all three and really liked the highlander and the pilot  i initially felt the 4runner had a bulky feel to it  but  after i drove the  sport  model with the x reas suspension my opinion changed  honda dealers will not negotiate the price of the pilot down by one penny and almost all options are extra  and they quickly add up  also  the pilot is not available with a sun roof  the highlander drove superbly and felt like a quality sedan  the main drawback was it was a little on the tame side and had somewhat of a minivan feel to it after i drove the 2003 4runner 6 cyl sport i knew i had found my vehicle  mercedes benz would be lucky if they could come up with an suv that drives this well  the sport suspension makes a big difference in handling  but that is just one component of a really nicely assembled package  the interior space is very well thought out  it is ergonomically comfortable and has the space earlier 4runners lacked  the fit and finish is really excellent  the controls and interior components look sharp  the seats are manually adjusting  but it doesn t take long to find a comfortable position  plus  there is a power lumbar adjustment the factory stereo is outstanding  this 4runner came equipped with lighted vanity mirrors which some models don t seem to have so far i have only driven only a few hundred miles but already i have driven through blinding snow and rain as well as deep  freshly fallen snow  watch out  this car will plow right through and not miss a beat  at all times it has felt secure  warm  and comfortable  bad weather performance shines  i just wish i could have kept that new car clean appearance at least a few days before confronting the winter elements  the 6cyl  gas mileage has been decent  an important factor to consider with the price of gas rising daily  ,one dramatic change runner must highly evolve body contour last runner move beyond trucklike stylish multi purpose vehicle last car precede get know every single technical dealers service department mainly numerous battle part failures require continuous visit back forth service want go focus attention three well rate vehicles hand pilot tooth highlander runner test drive three really like highlander pilot initially felt runner bulky feel drive sport model read suspension opinion change hand dealers negotiate price pilot one penny almost option extra quickly add also pilot available sun roof highlander drive superb felt like quality sedan main drawback little tame side somewhat midian feel drive runner cy sport know find vehicle precede bend would lucky could come sun drive well sport suspension make big difference handle one component really nicely assemble package interior space well think economically comfortable space earlier runners lack fit finish really excellent control interior components look sharp seat mentally adjust take long find comfortable position plus power lumbar adjustment factory sterno outstanding runner come equip light vanity mirror model seem far drive hundred miles already drive blind snow rain well deep freshly fall snow watch car plow right miss beat time felt secure warm comfortable bad weather performance shin wish could keep new car clean appearance least days confront winter elements cy gas mileage decent important factor consider price gas rise daily
44,camera, aiptek pocket cam 3mega i have tried out this camera on a sale or return basis and compared it with a cheap 0 3mp camera and the fuji finepix2800  i was considering it as a present in summary i would say that the aiptek is far superior to the 0 3mp pocket cameras as they are only just useful for small pictures on web pages  the finepix 2800 however has high quality pictures in still mode  excellent macro and close up features as well as a reasonably easy to use menu system  so this new camera was always going to be given a good run for its money by comparison the aiptek has only a poor close up facility so don t try to take pictures of your prize flowers as single heads  its closest view was about 45cm  when trying to photograph documents it just did not achieve the resolution to make an a4 or a5 document readable  the fuji had no problem with anything down to the size of a large postage stamp  one problem with the aiptek is the burn out when using the flash on fairly close range objects the aiptek has three resolutions 1mp  2mp and 3mp  when shooting a 30x25cm picture that filled the frame the aiptek produced only a mediocre quality picture even at 3mp  with or without the flash  the fuji did an excellent job  despite working at only 1mp long and middle range views in good light were fine the movie mode on the aiptek produced a clearer image than the fuji with a truer balance for artificial light  although the aiptek uses the faster compact flash cards to store images the need to use this camera in the 3mp mode means that it still takes several seconds to make the camera available to shoot  especially if using the flash as well the aiptek menu system is very straightforward and should not take long to learn power is supplied by 2 aa alkaline batteries that come with the camera the standard memory card is 16mb but i would always recommend at least 64mb the camera is quite a handy size and  being the size of many mobile phones  will fit into the pocket or handbag the zoom lens is only 3x  i soon missed the 6x optical zoom of my fuji  also the zoom mode was disabled while using the movie mode and there is no sound with picture  unlike the finepix the viewfinder is like to old compact cameras   i e  it has the same problem with parallax  whilst this makes it clearer than the fuji s electronic version it does make it harder to frame the picture accurately the viewfinder on the back is only slightly smaller than that of the fuji  it is large enough and bright enough to operate effectively in most lighting conditions  it is a little harder in very bright sun but that is common to many other viewing panels on other cameras overall i will return my review model and go back to my good old finepix 2800  this aiptek is easy to use and a handy size but does not seem to be good value to me and the resolution is well below what i would have expected for 3mp  ,aiptek pocket meg try camera sale return basis compare cheap camera full finepix consider present summary would say aiptek far superior pocket camera useful small picture web page finepix however high quality picture still mode excellent micro close feature well reasonably easy use menu system new camera always go give good run money comparison aiptek poor close facility try take picture prize flower single head closest view cm try photograph document achieve resolution make document readable full problem anything size large postage stamp one problem aiptek burn use flash fairly close range object aiptek three resolutions shoot cm picture fill frame aiptek produce mediocre quality picture even without flash full excellent job despite work long middle range view good light fine movie mode aiptek produce clearer image full truer balance artificial light although aiptek use faster compact flash card store image need use camera mode mean still take several second make camera available shoot especially use flash well aiptek menu system straightforward take long learn power supply alkaline batteries come camera standard memory card mb would always recommend least mb camera quite handy size size many mobile phone fit pocket sandbag room lens soon miss optical room full also room mode disable use movie mode sound picture unlike finepix viewfinder like old compact camera problem parallel whilst make clearer full electronic version make harder frame picture accurately viewfinder back slightly smaller full large enough bright enough operate effectively light condition little harder bright sun common many view panel camera overall return review model go back good old finepix aiptek easy use handy size seem good value resolution well would expect
45,camera, with a family of 7 we spent a lot of money on photo developing  i had been wanting a digital camera for quite some time but hadn t found a decent one in my price range since i would have to buy a good photo printer to go along with it this camera was quite an impulse buy  we were browsing through walmart and i saw this camera for sale with a kodak personal picture maker from lexmark in a package deal for  199  now  i usually don t buy electronic equipment from walmart because i view thier electronics department as very sub standard   instert plug for best buy here upon getting home with our new toy  i immediately started snapping pictures  set up was a breeze and this camera s features are wonderful  it is very easy to understand and use for the beginner  but has features that an avid photographer would admire i quickly found that without a memory card you don t get very far with this camera  i am able to store 6 pictures in the best setting on the internal 2mb memory of the camera  this cameras features include 3 flash settings  auto flash  full time flash and no flash  i almost always use no flash because the flash in this camera is extremely bright and washes out anything taken in just about any light  i actually took a picture of a friend in the pitch black of night with the flash on and it came out clear as day  i don t think it needs to be that bright other features are  a 2x zoom setting  i never use this feature because it is only available in the  good  setting and i always take my pictures in  best  it has a preview screen on the back that you can set to on or off  and can also turn on the quickview feature that shows you your picture immediately after it is taken  if you use the preview feature be prepared with a lot of batteries on hand this camera comes with software for uploading and editing pictures  uploading pictures is very easy  although very time and battery consuming  for 6 pictures i allow at least 10 minutes for uploading the photo editing software is great  you can crop  enhance  make photo greeting cards  although they only include christmas templates  and print multiple pictures on 1 sheet of paper  this camera takes amazingly clear and vivid pictures as long as you have fresh batteries  as the batteries age the capture time prolongs and you get some fuzziness and blurring if you do go ahead and buy this camera you will need to buy a memory card  i find that an 8mb card is sufficient for normal use  a lens cover  and usb a memory card reader to speed up the uploading time and save on battery life this camera alone retails for  119 at walmart  although i have seen it as high as  179  i recommend the package deal for maximum cost efficiency i plan to write a review on the printer seperately  ,family spend lot money photo develop want digital camera quite time find decent one price range since would buy good photo printer go along camera quite impulse buy browse palmar saw camera sale today personal picture maker remark package deal usually buy electronic equipment palmar view electronics department sub standard insert plug best buy upon get home new toy immediately start snap picture set breeze camera feature wonderful easy understand use beginner feature aid photographer would admire quickly find without memory card get far camera able store picture best set internal mb memory camera camera feature include flash settings auto flash full time flash flash almost always use flash flash camera extremely bright wish anything take light actually take picture friend pitch black night flash come clear day think need bright feature room set never use feature available good set always take picture best review screen back set also turn quickview feature show picture immediately take use review feature prepare lot batteries hand camera come software unload edit picture unload picture easy although time battery consume picture allow least minutes unload photo edit software great crop enhance make photo greet card although include christmas temples print multiple picture sheet paper camera take amazingly clear vivid picture long fresh batteries batteries age capture time prolong get dizziness slur go ahead buy camera need buy memory card find mb card sufficient normal use lens cover us memory card reader speed unload time save battery life camera alone detail palmar although see high recommend package deal maximum cost efficiency plan write review printer separately
46,auto, my friend owns this car and we drive to golf every week  the course is in the hills  lake chabot golf course  and the road is really curvy and windy  and through these trips i ve come up with my own opinions of the 1995 saab 900 the first useful aspect of the 900 is the trunk space  the trunk can fit both our golf bags have lots of room leftover  there s also a fair amount of room in the back row of seats  the head room is ample  but the foot space is a little cramped  the front passenger seat is  very  roomy  with enough space to stretch your legs   but i always have to sit in the back  oh well another thing i noticed was the acceleration  on freeway on ramps the 900 struggles a little to get up to speed  i would say it has moderate acceleration  sufficient but somewhat lacking back to the curving roads  while turning on those  i noticed some body roll on the car  it has good handling  but i think the stabilizer bars should be a little stiffer  some people prone to car sickness might feel a bit quesey while riding the the 900 but one very important thing to note is that my friend s 900 has been to the shop multiple times  he s even considered trying to declare it a lemon  so keep in mind that if you purchase the 1995 900 you might have to make multiple repairs and fix ups i think that the 1995 saab 900 is a good car overall  it s one big problem is reliability  over 2 visits to the shop per year is too much  so if buying a used 900  make sure it has a manufacturers used car warranty or something like that  just to be safe br br  ,friend own car drive golf every week course hill lake cabot golf course road really curly windy trip come opinions scab first useful aspect trunk space trunk fit golf bag lot room leftover also fair amount room back row seat head room ample foot space little cramp front passenger seat room enough space stretch legs always sit back oh well another thing notice acceleration freely camp struggle little get speed would say moderate acceleration sufficient somewhat lack back curve roads turn notice body roll car good handle think stabilizer bar little stiffen people prone car sickness might feel bite queen rid one important thing note friend shop multiple time even consider try declare lemon keep mind purchase might make multiple repair fix think scab good car overall one big problem reliability visit shop per year much buy use make sure manufacturers use car warranty something like safe br
47,camera, i bought this product to take photographs of items i was selling on ebay  it was the least expensive digital camera i could find at the time and from reading the box it seemed like the resolution would be fine for my purposes  but i have since learned that the quality is not nearly as good as you might think the store had one of the cameras set up for customers to try  but you can t actually see the photographs as they would appear on a computer  you can only test features and view the lcd display  and the pictures on the display lead you to believe that the pictures will be very high quality however when i got home and took some pictures with the camera i found out the quality wasn t nearly as good as i had expected  certainly the quality was passable  and i have since discovered ways to make the pictures look better  for instance taking pictures outside without the flash  but the quality just didn t meet my expectations  so if you re looking for something with professional results  as for business use  you will definitely want to look at something else i also have a problem with the fact that it eats batteries like crazy and it did not come with an adaptor to allow it to plug in to the wall  and you can not get an adaptor for the camera locally  it takes a special adaptor that you have to order from vivitar and it is rather expensive overall  this was a decent purchase for the money  though  and i would recommend this for someone looking for an inexpensive way to take pictures of family and friends for use as personal pictures br br  ,buy product take photograph items sell bay least expensive digital camera could find time read box seem like resolution would fine purpose since learn quality nearly good might think store one camera set customers try actually see photograph would appear computer test feature view lead display picture display lead believe picture high quality however get home take picture camera find quality nearly good expect certainly quality possible since discover ways make picture look better instance take picture outside without flash quality meet expectations look something professional result business use definitely want look something else also problem fact eat batteries like crazy come adapt allow plug wall get adapt camera locally take special adapt order visitor rather expensive overall decent purchase money though would recommend someone look expensive way take picture family friends use personal picture br
48,camera, i ve owned the sony cybershot f55 for about 10 months and i still love it  it has some drawbacks but it works very well  it has been extremely reliable  durable and produces high quality images  the mpeg movie feature is an added bonus but it is missing an optical zoom and usb support  this model is like the first in the cybershot series and the new dsc sxx cameras seem to address some of the problems with the f55 i originally got the f55 because it met all of my the requirements of producing high resolution  quality images as well as short  movie  clips so i didn t have to get a camcorder  although i ended up getting one later anyways  i intended the movie feature to be used to film the inside of homes for my mom s real estate business but i didn t find any software to edit the mpegs so it s been mostly a novelty and i ve used it on trips before we got the camcorder b it s great because b b  high resolution quality photos  the camera can record images in 1600x1200 pixels resolution with its carl zeiss lens  the coloration has been okay but not always perfect   sometimes it s has more green and often there is not enough contrast so the image looks dim and faded  the images sometimes come out a little blurry but when scaled down it is not noticeable  i ve ordered 4x6 inch prints of the photos i ve taken and they have come out fine from ofoto after making corrections through photoshop   1600x1200 has to be cropped to fit a 4x6 print  shutterfly and photoaccess prints had more contrast and green tinting which made the jpeg compression artifacts more noticeable in solid areas  ofoto says 1600x1200 pixel images are okay for 8x10 inch prints here is a gallery of photos i ve taken with the f55  http www zing com album id 4294236267 b  rechargeable battery  the camera uses sony s infolithium battery which is rechargeable and the camera comes with a recharger and an ac adaptor  i find recharging the battery gives it about an hour of use  at least according to the camera display  it uses less power when i put it on playback mode instead of record as well as turning the lcd backlight off  an hour of usage may not seem like a lot but a couple pictures here and a couple there ends up lasting the whole day for me and only when i m also taking pictures at night do i start running low on power b  lcd display  the  hybrid  lcd display supposedly uses sunlight to illuminate the screen and this means it makes no difference whether the back light is on or off  i can still see the display  but it s kind of washed out  and i can save battery power with the back light off b  good size  it s not too bulky like the mavica and it doesn t have a protruding lens like the f505  it fits really snug in this leather bag i got with the camera which i recommend to anyone who gets the camera  i m not sure where you can get it but it has a little pouch in the back perfect for holding extra memory sticks b  records mpeg movies  it can record mpeg movies in 320x240  up to 15 seconds  or 120x116  up to 60 seconds  i use microsoft media player to view the movie files but haven t found a software to edit the frames or strip out audio b  macro mode  i like taking close up photographs of objects and the macro option on the camera lets me do that without having to switch to a macro lens  the only draw back is that it is easy to blur the image because of movement and hard to tell it is blurred from the lcd display  it also has a short field of focus so sometimes other things closer or further away from the camera will be out of focus b  swivel lens  the lens rotates back 180 degrees and it s advertised as a way to take a picture or video of yourself while looking at the lcd  but seriously this flexibility is one of the best features of the camera  i use it to take pictures behind me of the sky or sunset when i am in a car  and i am not driving of course  if we are going the opposite direction or i am on the other side of the car  i can stick it out the window and rotate the lens so i see the view in the lcd  the lens on the newer f505 model swivels too but it seems not on the dsc sxx series b what could be improved b b  lack of optical zoom  there isn t an optical zoom  only a digital zoom on this camera  this has been acceptable for the most part because i don t find the need to zoom in very often  it s only when like i m trying to photograph animals that i wish there was a zoom  i would look into the other cybershot models if you need zoom options b  picturegear lite software  the picturegear software that comes with the camera is the  lite  version  it s pretty weak and the software basically only lets the user download the images from the camera using the serial connection  use a photo editing software like photo deluxe or photoshop if you want to manipulate the images  if you own a sony vaio you may have the complete picturegear version which has more options and supposedly lets you stitch together images to create a panoramic b  serial connection slow  lack of usb support  using the serial connection to download photos from the camera to the computer takes a very long time  what s worse is that i can t really do anything else on the computer when it is downloading  on top of that the picturegear software sometimes crashes  i ve given up using the serial method since i got a pcmcia card  the card lets me access the memory stick on a laptop as if it was a regular drive  then i hook up the laptop and my desktop computer on a network to get the files  there is a memory stick floppy adapter but i haven t tried it  neither the pcmcia card nor the floppy adaptor come with the camera  the f55 does not have usb support but the newer models do some of the new sony vaios have a memory stick slot on the side and that s one of the reasons i got a vaio for my mom  when we ve gone on trips  i only need to take the camera and laptop  after shooting a day s worth of pictures  i move the files off of the camera to laptop b  lack of non compressed file format  the camera only stores still images as jpegs and does not have the option to save in a non compressed format such as tiff  there are two options for the quality of the image   standard and fine  i always use the fine setting because i usually end up further processing the image through photo editing software like photoshop and the final picture has to go through jpeg compression on top of the jpeg compression from the camera so i have to get the image from the camera in the best quality format possible b  flash too strong  the camera doesn t offer the usual flash options like fill  red eye  etc  it basically has a high  normal and low setting which i think are all too strong and tends to wash out the image  in low light situations  i normally turn off the use of the flash because i find the exposure comes out better but i have to be cafeful and hold the camera still or the picture blurs  i have read about putting a piece of paper over the flash but i haven t tried that yet  also  some have reported red eye problems with the flash b  supplied 4mb memory stick too small  i can store about 8 10 stills at the highest quality and resolution and only about 3 4 videos at 320x240  when i m traveling  i am able to get by with a 16mb memory stick for the whole day and evening  storing about 20 30 pictures and some videos  occasionally i run out of room and start using the 8mb memory stick b  start up and recording time  i don t know how well the f55 compares to other digital cameras in terms of speed but there is a couple seconds delay when it starts up after i turn it on and when it records images and movies  basically all digital cameras i ve used have been like this and it gets annoying when timing is critical  when you try the cameras out in the store  keep this in mind b  lack of focus  aperature  film speed settings  the only options available are white balance  indoor outdoor  and exposure  b purchasing  when i purchased this camera  it was about  899 retail and i got it at fry s for  799 plus a 8mb memory stick for about  39  i returned the camera a week later because i found a sony employee in the area selling his camera for  650 on ebay  i not only got the camera plus the accessories it normally comes with  battery  recharger  ac adapter  serial cable  4mb memory stick  and software  but a soft leather case  a pcmcia card  for laptop  a 16mb memory stick and another 4mb memory stick  which came with the pcmcia card the retail price for the camera has dropped since my purchase but my advice is to go to the electronics store to use and look at the camera  then find the best deal by shopping online and looking at auctions and stores that don t require you to pay tax  buying from a local store is still the best option for people that want to get it immediately and like having the option to return or exchange it easily b conclusion  some newer models have come on the market in the u s  since i got the f55  just from visiting the sony web site  i see that they now have the dsc s30  dsc s50  dsc s70  and dsc f505 which address the usb support  tiff file format  and zoom options  the f55 is a great digital camera and i recommend it only because i ve been happy with the results but i will probably upgrade to a newer model in the future because they are available here is a gallery of photos i ve taken with the f55 http www zing com album id 4294236267 user reviews of f55 at dcresource com http www dcresource com reviews

49,camera, even though i see a few others have already written excellent reviews of this camera  i m still excited about purchasing mine   and thought i d chime in after doing a considerable bit of price feature comparisons for a digital camera in the  200 and under category  i ended up with the kodak cx4300  walmart sells them for  179 95  only  30 more than the price of the comparable 2 1 megapixel version for the money  i think this camera covers all the important bases  you get an lcd screen to preview your photos  which you re not going to have on the sub  100 dig  cameras as a rule  a glass lens instead of a lower quality plastic one  a built in flash with red eye reduction  a key feature  imo  plus ability to use only  fill flash   also key  a timer  so you can get into your own photos  the best resolution in its class  at 3mp  and backed by a company that s been doing cameras and film for a long time compared to some other digital cameras i ve used  including a  700 or so sony mavica  i think this kodak does an impressive job of properly capturing colors and handling indoor lighting   on the mavica i used  i often had problems with indoor photos coming out too dark  and requiring some touch up in photoshop before they looked really good  as for colors  the cheaper digital cameras often don t capture darker shades of red burgandy maroon properly  i had no such issue with this kodak on the downside though  the camera does have a few small flaws and faults  my lens cap fits fine  unlike one reviewers  apparently  but i m not really thrilled that it has one in the first place  their cheaper 2 1mp camera has a built in lens cover that shutters over the lens whenever you switch off the power  i d prefer that so there s one less thing to lose or break  i also ran into the problem of the directional toggle button accidently thinking i pushed a direction when i was trying to push down the middle of it to confirm a menu choice  some sort of true optical zoom would have been nice  too  i think i would have paid an extra  20 25 for that  if it was available i also agree with the reviewer who complained that at  70  the optional  easyshare dock  is a marketing ploy  how hard is to push a usb cable into the side of the camera and have your pc auto detect it and start transferring photos  the camera simply doesn t  need  a dock to make this operation easier  the charger built in the dock is great  but it should have come with the camera  ,even though see others already write excellent review camera still excite purchase mine think chime considerable bite price feature comparisons digital camera category end today c palmar cells price comparable megapixel version money think camera cover important base get lead screen review photo go sub dig camera rule glass lens instead lower quality plastic one build flash red eye reduction key feature mio plus ability use fill flash also key time get photo best resolution class back company camera film long time compare digital camera use include sonya mavra think today impressive job properly capture color handle indoor light mavra use often problems indoor photo come dark require touch photoshop look really good color cheaper digital camera often capture darker shade red burgundy maroon properly issue today downside though camera small flaw fault lens cap fit fine unlike one review apparently really thrill one first place cheaper camera build lens cover shutter lens whenever switch power prefer one less thing lose break also run problem direction tongue button accidently think push direction try push middle confirm menu choice sort true optical room would nice think would pay extra available also agree review complain optional easyshare dock market play hard push us cable side camera pp auto detect start transfer photo camera simply need dock make operation easier charge build dock great come camera
50,camera, with my best friend living on the other side of the country  i got a little tired of constantly describing things i had purchased or what size the herbs i was growing had gotten  i decided that i would invest in a digital camera and send her pictures instead  believe me  i wasn t that great at describing things  and often left my best friend saying   quot uh  i guess i can picture it quot  now  i just take a pic  download it onto my computer and send it to her in a matter of minutes i researched and came across the olympus d 360l  i was attracted to the relatively low price  299  and the high amount of megapixel for the price  1 3  i also liked that it could be used on both an ibm and mac  having an lcd screen was very important to me too  the camera is very sleek looking and is easy to carry  there is an optional carrying case that you can purchase  the lcd viewing window allows you to see the shot immediately  so you can delete the ones you don t like  that way  every shot you keep is a good one  it s also fun to take silly pics without worrying that you ll be wasting space  the camera has a menu of functions  such as the quality of shot you want  date time print  cropping a shot  shutter speed  etc  you can also adjust the flash for an indoor shot  overcast day or an outdoor shot  it also has a sequence function  where it will take several shots right in a row  it has a timer also  the quality of the pictures are excellent  several people have commented on how much detail the pictures have and how crisp they are  the camera comes with a program that allows you to edit the picture on your computer  the camera can take lots of shots  more if you use a lower quality of shot  i ve never had a problem with it running out of space  if you are on a long trip  however  you might want to download onto a computer more often i ve used the camera both indoors and outdoors and i ve never been disappointed in the camera s performance  i have been disappointed in how i look in the pic  but that s not the poor camera s fault lol one of the problems i have with the camera is the menu is a bit confusing without the manual  also  it uses up batteries pretty quickly  4 aaa  i purchased rechargeable batteries  which have solved the problem and have saved a lot of money i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a moderately priced digital camera that offers a lot of features  the camera is sleek and light and take wonderful pictures  your friends and family will love getting such wonderful pictures from you br br  ,best friend live side country get little tire constantly describe things purchase size grow get decide would invest digital camera send picture instead believe great describe things often leave best friend say quit guess picture quit take pick download onto computer send matter minutes research come across polypus attract relatively low price high amount megapixel price also like could use ism mac lead screen important camera sleek look easy carry optional carry case purchase lead view window allow see shoot immediately delete ones like way every shoot keep good one also fun take silly pick without worry waste space camera menu function quality shoot want date time print drop shoot shutter speed etc also adjust flash indoor shoot overcast day outdoor shoot also sequence function take several shots right row time also quality picture excellent several people comment much detail picture crisp camera come program allow edit picture computer camera take lot shots use lower quality shoot never problem run space long trip however might want download onto computer often use camera indoors outdoor never disappoint camera performance disappoint look pick poor camera fault one problems camera menu bite confuse without manual also use batteries pretty quickly ana purchase rechargeable batteries solve problem save lot money would highly recommend camera anyone look moderately price digital camera offer lot feature camera sleek light take wonderful picture friends family love get wonderful picture br
51,camera, i needed a digital camera for my online business  so my hubby  who is the techie in the house  started researching cameras  he has won some photography awards and i was willing to defer to his judgement even though it seemed that the one he picked out was a bit complex for me  well  i should have listened to the inner voice the olympus d 600l has a lithium battery for the flash  for regular operation it takes 4 aa batteries  actually  i should say it  eats  them because they do not even last through one session  there are power supplies that will work and i do recommend that you get one because otherwise you will need to buy stock in duracell the camera is large and does not come with a carrying case  as it is an expensive piece of equipment that  to me  is a serious flaw  there is a built in flash and a zoom lens  but only a 3x zoom so you can t get really  close up  from  far away  all of the operating buttons are easily accessible on the back and top  but there are a lot of them and you really need to know what they mean the screen that shows the picture you have just taken reflects a fair amount of light  so you really can t see it well in the sun  that is also where instructions and settings appear for fixing the brightness and detail of the pictures and this can be a real problem on a nice day  there is an instruction book but it is long and somewhat difficult because it is in three languages on each page so you have to look for the one you understand best  it would have been better to just put them in sections of english  french and spanish the olympus d 600l does not self adjust at all  if you do not get the settings just right the colors are way off  since i sell clothing  this is a major problem for displaying my products overall  i am not thrilled with this product  it will take nice pictures  but so will some of the simpler digitals  perhaps for an expert it is a superior camera  but for someone with minimal experience it is a maximal pain to use br br  ,need digital camera online business hobby tache house start search camera photography award will defer judgement even though seem one pick bite complex well listen inner voice polypus lithium battery flash regular operation take batteries actually say eat even last one session power supply work recommend get one otherwise need buy stock duracell camera large come carry case expensive piece equipment serious flaw build flash room lens room get really close far away operate button easily accessible back top lot really need know mean screen show picture take reflect fair amount light really see well sun also instructions settings appear fix brightness detail picture real problem nice day instruction book long somewhat difficult three languages page look one understand best would better put section english french spanish polypus self adjust get settings right color way since sell clothe major problem display products overall thrill product take nice picture simpler digital perhaps expert superior camera someone minimal experience animal pain use br
52,camera, i have a sony mavica fd83 that i have been very pleased with in terms of decent shots  decent color  however  it is very bulky to take  and it ends up staying at home  in addition  on a vacation  dealing with fifty floppies is daunting to say the least  so  i wanted a small take anywhere camera that i could take on vacation  i settled on the nikon coolpix 885 because of nikon s reputation and because of a few positive online reviews of the camera  the camera is well made and fairly easy to use  what the problem is and this is something that i could have known had i read reviews on the digital web sites is that it had a markedly red coloration to pictures  especially indoors  this was noticed not only by myself  an avid amateur photographer  but also by my wife and my mom both who are point and shooters  it was so bad that i returned the camera for a loss  and had to sell  again at a big loss  the rechargeable battery and charger that i bought for it  while we are on the subject  i think it is horrible marketing to sell the camera without the recharger and rechargeable battery  this is a 120 dollar  hidden cost  because no one in their right mind is going to buy expensive throwaway batteries for their camera  nikon s customer service was about as unconcerned as they could be  in spite of many user comments and complaints about this problem  they denied it completely  the technical person said that he thought this problem might be fixed in the next firmware upgrade  but had no information  since those technicians are in japan and don t communicate what they are working on to the us technical staff  as a result of this  i will never ever purchase a nikon product again  i went out and did some more research  and ended up with a canon powershot s110  which cost 330 dollars  i could not be happier with this tiny gem of a camera  and i take it everywhere  ,sonya mavra ff please term decent shots decent color however bulky take end stay home addition vacation deal fifty flop dance say least want small take anywhere camera could take vacation settle union coolpix union reputation positive online review camera camera well make fairly easy use problem something could know read review digital web sit markedly red coloration picture especially indoors notice aid amateur photographer also wife mon point shutter bad return camera loss sell big loss rechargeable battery charge buy subject think horrible market sell camera without recharger rechargeable battery dollar hide cost one right mind go buy expensive throwaway batteries camera union customer service unconcerned could spite many user comment complaints problem deny completely technical person say think problem might fix next firmware upgrade information since technicians japan communicate work us technical staff result never ever purchase union product go research end canon powershot cost dollars could happier tiny gem camera take everywhere

54,camera, take an old pro who has used most of the world s best cameras   leica  contax  linhof  nikon  canon and olympus  and buy him his first digital camera  and this is what you get first look  new and right out of its package  first impression  flimsy yes  this little plastic wonder does not radiate confidence that it will last very long under professional use  it weighs next to nothing and except for the word   quot olympus quot  in bright silvery letters and the word   quot camedia quot  in red  the rest of it is midnight black  it comes with a set of lithium batteries  non rechargable  and a wafer sized infra red remote control  you will also find three  3  instruction booklets  one each for english  spanish and french  each one of these booklets are 223 pages thick and believe me  you are going to need one of them to study every word  this camera s secrets are available through push button programming via 9 buttons and one 5 position dial  these controls govern the whole gambet of the camera s many capabilities which you can read in full within the instruction book  before you can learn to program all functions of the camera  you may find that you may run down batteries faster than a corn husker s convention shucking husks  i chose to save the exepensive lithium batteries for a time when i would need serious use  and i began using sets of nicads i had on hand  a fully charged set of nicads will only last 20 minutes if you are exercising the camera while learning its functions  olympus recommends aa sized nickel metal hydride batteries and these will give you good service and are rechargable in the learning phase  you might like to buy an ac supply so that you can run the camera as long as you like  but once you are passed the testing stage  it is likely you will be satisfied to rely on the hydrides  the camera uses 4 of these aa batteries and i find that buying two sets  8 cells  you will probably be able to cover a lot of shooting with one set charging and the other set in the camera  make no mistake  this is a power hungry machine the controls of this camera are ergonomically easy to use but the sequence of button pushing is more awkward than any film camera ever made  you will have to concentrate and learn to go through several levels of button pushing to crank up features you want to use or not use  having said all this  let me now say that this camera is absolutely amazing  i find it extremely accurate and it does some things impossible for film cameras to duplicate  for instance  the panorama feature seamlessly assembles up to ten frames of exposures to make views that stagger the imagination  a full 360 degrees is easy to do  part of this operation is done in the caamera and part of it is done in the computer by the supplied software  this featurte only works with the olympus smart card in the camera  this is the 16 megabyte card that comes with the camera  additional cards maybe purchased but are quite expensive  100 for a 32 meg  smart card i do not like the lens projecting out from the camera when the power is turned on  the plastic barrel surrounding the lens when it extends is a loosly fitting and cheap looking device that makes the camera look like it came out of a cracker jack box  hardly resembling a camera that costs nearly a thousand dollars  in fact the whole camera looks like cheap junk  but yes  it does do everything it is advertised to do  experimentally  i enlarged one high resolution frame to 16 quot  x 20 quot  scale  cropped to 8 5 quot  x 11 quot  and was quire pleased with the resultant photograph  i think once i become more adept at programming this camera i would not hesitate to use it professionally  but this camera is not for everyone  most casual users will probably never want to disable the flash  or over ride the automatic features which is precisely why i wanted this camera  if only automatic features are wanted one would do better by buying a simpler digital camera that would be easier to set up  for me  i like to be able to do side lighting with strobes  i like to shoot existing light  i like to do bounce lighting  and i like to  quot fudge quot  exposures for dramatic effects  i also like to shoot in black and white and yes  this camera can do that and sepia too  photos in black and white make splendid  full tone scale prints  razor sharp at 8 quot  x 10 quot  and with software  amazing possiblities are available  i don t think i can ever give this camera up  it s great     ,take old pro use world best camera lice contact lingo union

56,auto, the volvo xc90 has  like all volvos  a truly horrible name  it baffles me that people as nice as the swedes  150 forward looking  neutral  sauna inhabiting  high living socialists that they are  150 couldn 146t come up with something more friendly than xc90  i know that it 146s probably code for enormous volvo suv that looks like a great big car  rather than a box on wheels  and goes like stink but i don 146t like it  it 146s just not blonde enough  volvos should be called things like sven or agneta  but enough of my inane rambling and into the review proper the volvo xc90 is of course about as swedish as bruce springstein  conceived in america for america roads  american wallets and american sensibilities it is in fact a posh ford  no doubt the swedes were conned into selling to the blue oval  a misunderstanding involving a cell phone with poor reception  a fjord 2 hrs outside of stockholm and a half gallon of inexplicably expensive vodka  but sold they were and since then the pressure has been on to produce an suv of course the suv should have been a volvo concept  forever the masters of the utilitarian over the sexy  the safe over the breath taking and the roomy  remember those huge wagons  over the sensible  how many people really shifted furniture that often  volvo should have cleaned up in what the uk calls the  145grass  145n 146 gravel 146 market  150 allowing its owners to scamper across verges and up long driveways with not a whimper of complaint  alas the volvo bank account resembled that of mike tyson and so the never got around to developing the car that could define them  until ford came along  dipped deeper into debt and provided a much needed injection of cash a totally free hand of course was not granted  150 volvo is now as much a part of the re engineered platform world as any manufacturer and thus the xc90 sits on a platform developed for the s80  volvo imaginatively called this platform the e2  150 oh to be in their  145namestorms 146  huh  what this does is give the xc90 very car like proportions  or at least it looks as though it has car like proportions  it is in fact much bigger than it looks  much  much bigger  imagine bumping in to garly coleman and realizing that he could have a shot at the nba  a shock  right  not as much of a shock as the volvo 146s proportions  whilst it shares length and width with the s80 it 146s a full 14 inches taller  a riot of headroom  of course what those extra inches give is the appearance of ground clearance and that high driving position that invokes in us all a feeling of imperiousness so let 146s start by walking around the car  it looks like  well  it looks like a great big volvo  it 146s very slabby  very angular and has that swedish aversion to curves that has been the marque 146s signature  from the rear the tail lights absolutely dominate  erupting into huge pillars that seem to make up the entire rear pillars and threaten a vegas like explosion of light should you set foot on break  there 146s lots of matt black plastic as  145skirting 146  150 no doubt in a bid to establish  145off road credentials 146  150 clean they look a little tacky  but get some mud splashes going and they seem to blend in to the overall design well  the rear spilts 70 30 but seems a little high  necessitating a bend of the knees as you load up the groceries inside things are a step up from the usual volvo blandness  there 146s lots of light colors  adding to airiness  there 146s wood that looks like wood and fake aluminum that looks like  erm  fake aluminum  the overall effect is pleasing and the car feels built to last  dash layout is simple to the point of insulting but again feels very volvo with only four things  speed  distance  temperature and fuel level  outlined  i found the driving position to be excellent if a little bus like  my wife had more problems  saying that the high wheel and upright position made her feel like a kid behind the wheel of her dad 146s car  she 146s 5 146 4 148  i think  she also had problems with the thick pillars restricting vision  something i 146ve read about but didn 146t experience myself  seats are great as you 146d expect  with the leather adding a real volvo smell to the mix  lumbar support is adjustable and excellent as is the whiplash control  there are lots of seats too  three rows of them doing all manner of clever tricks  folding in numerous ways and demanding a degree in applied algebra to quantify their cleverness  you can even make one row disappear entirely  the back row is less than roomy  not ideal for small kids  too far away to reach  and therefore designed exclusively  as far as i can tell  for those annoying 8 10 year olds who want to play  145rip the arms off expensive future collectables 146  still the lay out is fine and dandy and everything feels too well made for a car that is ultimately going to be trashed by the carrying of kids  dogs and elderly relative 146s furniture start her up and things get even sweeter  volvo may be know for its 5 cyl engines but the 2 9l 6 cyl engine is just as sweet  280lbs of torque below 2 000 rpm is good for initial shunt  or pulling that trailer  and with 268 bhp there 146s plenty of power too  the automatic gearbox does a good job of keeping forward momentum  150 yes there 146s a little turbo lag and you 146re not going to lose many people from he lights but the car pulls and keeps pulling all the way to the redline all wheels are driven  giving safe but unremarkable response  you know what the volvo is going to do  150 it 146s safe  it 146s unremarkable  not overly involving  150 very swedish  quite detached and a little cold perhaps but responsive  the car is a pretty relaxing place to be  150 you waft along  a little too upright but feeling quite unnoticed at speeds slightly faster than you 146d imagine  we didn 146t take the car off road but have heard that it copes okay and that 146s good enough  150 you don 146t buy something this plutocratic to get it dirty down on the farm head quickly into a corner and you 146re going to feel your lunch rising in your throat  150 this isn 146t a taut car by any measure but one  150 that measure being other suvs and against those it more than holds its own safety of course is a volvo advantage  though renault beat them  and this car is no exception  here are some of the unique safety features  taken from the website  assume that every other safety feature is included  150 you 146ll be right 149 roll stability control  ft  gyrosocopic sensoring  it won 146t roll over then 149 full length  145curtain 146 airbags  protecting every seat 149 all seat seatbelt pre tensioners 149 lower cross members  150 saving you from  145mounting 146 other cars in case of accident 149 pedestrian crumple zones  150 saving people when you mow them down 149 whiplash protection  150 the front seats move back in case of impact  saving you whiplash pretty safe then the volvo is swedish in the way it 146s equipeed however  150 this car is stacked like a pneumatic blonde  150 with front and rear controls for the climate control  electric driver 146s seat  cruise  nice leather  real wood and a cd player good enough to have in your study so what did we think about the volvo  well like roxette  another fine swedish export  it was well put together  very professional and perhaps a little too polished  i like to drive   to feel a car moving fluidly with me and the volvo didn 146t really allow me to do that  150 wallowing through bends when pushed and quietly letting you know that this kind of behavior really isn 146t on and the looks are a bit of a turn off too  it looks exactly as you 146d expect and american volvo to look  150 supersized  alas it 146s a look that just doesn 146t come off of course the volvo wasn 146t made for me  it was made for people with children  and dogs  and all the stuff that comes with children and dogs  it was designed to deal with the baggage  physical and emotional  the desperate need for safety above all and the even more desperate need for a little space that having kids brings  that and to look suitably expensive  not to mention expansive  on the lawn  with that in mind this car is a complete success now where did i put those condoms  ,vulvo c like vols truly horrible name baffle people

57,auto, i am writing this opinion because i feel i m fairly educated in regards to jeep wranglers being that i have owned two myself  my first jeep was a rebuilt 1979 cj 7  this was a great second car but by no means a reliable car to drive everyday  i used this car for entertainment purposes only due to the fact that it was an extremely bumpy ride  not comfortable for long periods of time driving and very loud  the car i specifically writing about is my last previous car which i drove for two years  this was a 1997 jeep wrangler sport 4x4  if you are interesting in purchasing this car there are many pros and cons that i feel you should know about  i guess a few years after selling my  79 jeep i began to think that i really wanted a newer model  so  i began my research pros it s no doubt a  quot fun quot  vehicle  i live in a major city so most of my driving time was city miles  many days of the summer spent with the top down and is no doubt an eye catcher for many people  at night  it was wonderful to drive with the top down  i had a 6 cylinder which came in handy in pulling my jet skis  but my sister has a 1999 jeep wrangler 4 cylinder and it handled the load with no difficulty either  i opted for more power which driving on the highway in dallas is almost a necessity to get on the highway  more power   faster speed in less time  cons if you are interested in a jeep  please consider opting for the extended warranty  i bought my 1997 jeep in the first of 1998 with little miles  i purchased the extended warranty which came in handy  my factory warranty ended at 36 000 miles and it 40 000 miles the top formed a tear in the seam extended from the windshield all the way to the back of the top of the jeep  at 60 000 miles my differential axle busted which was a whopping  2 000 at the dealership that was covered by the extended warranty all the while the furnished a rental car for me to drive  fortunately  the wheel base in the model is wider than previous years so i felt comfortable driving at speeds of 70 80 miles without worrying about flipping but the wind noise on the soft top was uncomfortable and extremely loud  no doubt over time you will get used to this noise or you will end up selling because of it  you either like it or hate it  i grew to like it because i upgraded my stereo system to drown out some of the noise  another con is the soft tops  this is no doubt a welcoming invite for thieves to enter your car  over a two and a half year span  i had my car broken into 4 times  3 of which the thief entered my car by slashing the plastic windows  this is also a hassle if you don t have a garage  for me  i don t have a garage  this also meant  that every time i wanted to take my top off  which alone is a strenuous process that can take up 20 minutes  i had to also put it back on at the end of the day  it is inevitable that your plastic windows over time will become somewhat of a foggy or less transparent look  mine in case were scratched very easily  another issue to address is space  i forgot how much of a packrat i am and how much stuff i actually lug around  this is not the vehicle for you if you are the same  i could never go anywhere and leave anything at all in my car for fear of it being stolen  every time i remember this  it was always too late  i was already where i needed to be and totally forgot and would end up lugging around a big duffle bag at the mall for example  most people would probably remember these things  but again  i m not like most people so i m touching on this topic for a fyi for some who it would also apply to overall  i would say this car would be perfect for someone in their teens to midtwenties  i m 26 and after having the luxuries of a car  began to miss those luxuries after driving a jeep  i would love to own another one  but not as my primary means of transportation revised 6 26 00 as per request on a comment  i ll give a little more helpful info  as i said before  my sister has a jeep practically identical to mine  one major difference is the seating  i opted for the vinyl seats which was a big mistake  in the summertime  it gets extremely hot and very easy to sweat  my sister had cloth interior which was extremely comfortable  the vinyl seats also with time developed cracks which should not have happened because i always kept them clean and cleaned them with the recommended solution  the seats were pretty comfortable in regards to adjustments but the material in the vinyl made them uncomfortable  in regards to how it handles  i put 30 quot  tires on my jeep so it handled relatively well  the only time s  it somewhat scared me was when i unexpectedly took a corner and found out the street was a tad wet and i did a complete 180  that took me for a little loop  over the course of owning my jeep  i did this several times  but  it handled really well     ,write opinion feel fairly educate regard deep grangers own two first deep rebuild c great

58,camera,   background   i do not own this camera  but a friend of mine got it for christmas and i spent some time playing with it  and here are my thoughts on it b  camera asthetics   the camera itself looks pretty cool  it s small size allows it to be placed easily into most pants coat pockets one of the things i noticed right off the bat was  in place of a manual lens cover  there is an automatic protective barrier instead which opens and closes when you turn the camera on or off  that is pretty handy to me  because on my olympus c4040  which is a larger camera  the lens cap tends to be somewhat of a pain if it s windy outside and you re trying to take pictures  it blows around and may even hit the camera as the cap dangles from its cord speaking of power on  that is something i don t like about the sony  you have to turn  power on  and then select your shooting mode  on the olympus you simply turn the dial and it comes on  ready to go  no extra step the 1 5  lcd has a surprisingly high resolution  when reviewing pictures  i was amazed at how clear and crisp the images were menu navigation was fairly intuitive  but since i didn t have the manual  some of the symbols were a little cryptic and i couldn t figure out what they were  if you ve had previous experience with digital cameras or photography  you shouldn t have any problems with this camera    picture quality   the various image resolutions to choose from are shown below for the included 32 mb memory stick memory fine standard 2592x1944  5mp  12 23 2592x1728  3 2  12 23 2048x1536  3mp  20 37 1280x960  1mp  50 93 640x480  vga  196 491 the images we were shooting with the camera were mostly at the 2048x1536 standard resolution at 3mp  the color detail at this level was very impressive  we were inside a restaurant with other friends at the time  and all the pictures came out looking amazing  were they as good as ones shot with my 4mp olympus  i don t know  but if i had to guess  the color detail was better with the sony than i would have gotten shooting with my camera some mpg vx video was shot  and wow i was really impressed with the quality of video taken in the low light restaurant situation  it wasn t grainy at all  and the frame rate and audio sync were excellent  i think the file end up being almost 7mb for about 20 seconds i wouldn t suggest using the camera as a camcorder though  but it is good to know that it does have this ability should the need ever arise b  things to consider   batteries this particular sony model uses a proprietary sony battery  model np fc11  i personally find this as somewhat of a big negative on the camera  from a casual user standpoint  for the following reasons 1  to buy an additional rechargeable battery is  49 95  everyone needs at least one additional  if not two additional batteries  if you travel and are out away from your hotel room or ship room  and your battery dies during your excursion down in the kileua caldera on the big island of hawaii  then what are you going to do  you see my point  you should always carry multiple batteries 2  along the obvious same lines as  1  it doesn t use standard aa batteries which can be bought from just about anywhere at anytime true story example  last year i was at a professional women s billiards tournament in tunica  ms  a lot of famous people were there  and i was taking pictures like there was no tomorrow  both of the famous people  and me with the famous people  towards the end of the day  i had completely exhausted my original set and backup set of batteries  but there was still more to do  so  being about 30 minutes from our hotel room  i just went to the hotel store and picked up a pack of aa batteries  popped  em in and shot the rest of the night if i would have had a cam that used special batteries  i would have been screwed  so that s my main hang up on batteries and digital cameras get a card reader i highly recommend getting the card reader accessory from sandisk  it s cheap  20  and allows for some major convenience when transferring pics to your computer  if you use windows xp  it s a plug and play device  i borrowed my friends  came in  hooked it up to the usb port on my puter and transferred the files off the memory stick with no problems  the computer treats the memory reader as a separate disk drive  kewl carrying case   that s up to you  i don t have one  but my friend bought one for the sony  i personally think  in most situations they can be more trouble than they are worth  especially if you are travelling  but it depends on your travel situation extended warranties   these days technology advances at such a rapid pace  in 12 months  the camera will only be worth a fraction of what you paid for it  it is for this reason  i do not recommend the purcahse of extended warranties on electronic items  by the time the standard warranty has expired  99 times out of 100 you re better of junking it  and buying something new and better  many times for less than what paid for what you re throwing away b  conclusion   the camera is pretty expensive  retailing for  450  so it may be out of some people s price range  however  it s small size and high quality images make it a pretty good contender if those things are important to you  ,background camera friend mine get christmas spend time play thoughts camera aesthetic camera look pretty cool small size allow place easily part coat pocket one things notice right bat place manual lens cover automatic protective barrier instead open close turn camera pretty handy polypus larger camera lens cap tend somewhat pain windy outside try take picture blow around may even hit camera cap dangle cord speak power something like sonya turn power select shoot mode polypus simply turn dial come ready go extra step lead surprisingly high resolution review picture amaze clear crisp image menu navigation fairly intuition since manual symbols little cystic figure previous experience digital camera photography problems camera picture quality various image resolutions choose show include mb memory stick memory fine standard va image shoot camera mostly standard resolution color detail level impressive inside restaurant friends time picture come look amaze good ones shoot polypus know guess color detail better sonya would get shoot camera pg video shoot really impress quality video take low light restaurant situation grain frame rate audit son excellent think file end almost mb second suggest use camera camcorder though good know ability need ever arise things consider batteries particular sonya model use proprietary sonya battery model ff personally find somewhat big negative camera casual user standpoint follow reason buy additional rechargeable battery everyone need least one additional two additional batteries travel away hotel room ship room battery die excursion ileum calder big island hawaii go see point always carry multiple batteries along obvious line use standard batteries buy anywhere daytime true story example last year professional women belliard tournament tunica ms lot famous people take picture like tomorrow famous people famous people towards end day completely exhaust original set back set batteries still minutes hotel room go hotel store pick pack batteries pop em shoot rest night would use

60,camera, being only the second digital camera i have ever used  i m going to say that hp315 is a pretty nice little camera  it is best made for whoever wants to take some nice quality pictures and is willing to take a step forward with the technology  it is relatively small  smaller than the slr models and is not heavy at all  the photo quality is great  much better other similar cameras  that are in the same price range it has 2 1 megapixels and you can choose if you want to shoot in regular  fine  or superfine mode  naturally  superfine requires more memory on the 8 mb card  only allowing you to take a total of 10 superfine photos before you download them onto your computer  in regular mode you can take up to 50  there is a 1 8 inch color screen on the back of the camera  allowing you to view and select photos for deletion or downloading  to take pictures you can either just look through the viewfinder or turn on the lcd and look through that  using the lcd does however drain the battery rather quickly  so i try to avoid it unless i want to view already taken pictures  the hp315 does have a 2 5 digital zoom  however  to take pictures using the zoom is a bit difficult  you have to turn on the lcd to do this  draining battery  however  it does help to produce beautiful shots  overall  i would say that this is a great little camera  it has a nice weight  is easy to operate and has handy little rubber grips on it so that you don t drop it  if you have the money  you should look into it br br  ,second digital camera ever use go say pretty nice little camera best make whoever want take nice quality picture will take step forward technology relatively small smaller sir model heavy photo quality great much better similar camera price range megapixels choose want shoot regular fine supervise mode naturally supervise require memory mb card allow take total supervise photo download onto computer regular mode take inch color screen back camera allow view select photo deletions download take picture either look viewfinder turn lead look use lead however drain battery rather quickly try avoid unless want view already take picture digital room however take picture use room bite difficult turn lead drain battery however help produce beautiful shots overall would say great little camera nice weight easy operate handy little rubber grip drop money look br
61,camera,  image size b  3 2 mega pixels  viewed on my pc  the images look great and are huge  i don t print photos  so i cannot comment on the print quality b zoom b  10x optical 4x digital   optical zoom is the most important factor here i  most digi cams have only a 3x or 4x optical zoom  i specifically wanted a longer zoom so i could use the camera for sports   outdoors photography  digital zoom doesn t matter at all  since i m not printing directly from the camera  i can always use photo editing freeware on my pc to digitally zoom  i haven t turned the digital zoom feature back on since i tested it useless to me b focus b  rapid auto focus or manual focus  the rapid af is very fast and has kept my images perfectly focused so far  i m very impressed with the manual focus feature  easy to activate  easy to use  and a rare feature in most cameras these days   manual focus will only be useful for certain photography  so if you want a point and shoot  this is a useless feature i  my girlfriend shoots art photos  so she loves the manual focus b flash b  auto flash  auto flash w  red eye reduct  manual flash    fill flash  the fill flash setting is used for dark photographs where you want to see background details  fill flash has a long shutter time  so your subject needs to stay still   you need a tripod to use it   of course  you can turn flash off altogether  there is also an accessory shoe on this camera for using other flashes  the built in flash is powerful enough to illuminate objects 20 feet or so away b movie recording b  record up to 640x480 movies at either 15 or 30 frames per second  30 fps is great for a digital camera  however  recording at 640x480 at 30 fps takes about 1 mb per second of movie time   if you want to make digital movies  get a digital movie camera  i don t care to use my still cam for movies  so this feature didn t matter to me at all i  i did try this feature just for s g  when played back on the camera lcd screen  audio was slightly out of sync w  video  haven t tried it on my pc yet b macro mode b  super macro mode allows you to take photos of objects as close as 4 cm from the camera lens b fast startup b  this camera will startup uber fast  ready to shoot a photo in less than 2 seconds from when you touch the power button  no title screens  no brand name shots  no menu screen at startup   this is one of my favorite features  every digital camera i ve ever used takes 10 seconds or more to start up  sometimes up to 20 seconds  i ve often missed photo opportunities because of long startup times i b viewfinder b  there is no real viewfinder for this camera  you see exactly what is going to be recorded  with photo information overlaying the view  the viewfinder is the same view as the lcd screen  reflected to the eyepiece using a mechanical mirror  the mirror thing was a good idea  saves money on separate screens  but the camera has to be on to frame a potential subject  and the extra mechanics are more likely to get damaged than a passive viewfinder b notable features b  custom or auto white balance control  dark noise reduction  creative color modes  natural color

62,auto, we like to keep our cars quite a long time  which is not hard  since they have been volkswagens  and during the last couple of years we have them  we go and test drive  everything  that appeals to us at all  so that we are educated when we do finally purchase  we are not blindly loyal to vw  but they just seem to have the most car for the money most of the time  the  98 vw passat was redesigned for that year  and it was just so refreshingly new  we liked it from the first test drive  it felt heavier than the jettas and golfs that we were used to  and it has the 15  wheels  which means a smoother ride than the 14  or smaller wheels  this was the first car this large that we would be buying  there is so much leg room and head room  and the seats are the most comfortable that vw has offered  once we drove the passat  we were sold  we bought the 4 cylinder standard transmission model with the heated leather seats  we had never had heated seats  and i had thought  boy  what a gimmick  well  unless the weather is quite warm  those heated seats are just great  even of a moderately cool day  it feels good to get in and warm up the seats  even if we turn them off soon  this item just makes a world of difference in the comfort level  and people who have ridden with us have been very impressed our passat is a light aquamarine called elegant green  and it does turn heads  it is a beautiful  soft shade i also rate the back seat favorably  it is roomy and comfortable  with the head room and leg room for adults to ride in back  and we have had a number of people say that it is the most comfortable and roomy back seat they have ever been in  i think many manufacturers look at the back seat as where the kids and maybe the dog rides  so how nice does it have to be  volkswagen makes every seat in the passat comfortable for  adults unlike  it seems  most people  i don t car for a sun roof or moon roof  so i cannot comment on vw s  since our passat does not have one we have had very little trouble with this car  in fact  i don t recall any repairs  we just got the regular maintenance  we did have the front brakes relined  which surprised us a little  since we normally go a long time between brake jobs  but then  this car is heavier than our previous ones  nothing has actually broken on the car  reliability is the most important thing to us  and i think we got this with the passat the main negative for me is the air conditioning  we live in the west virginia northern panhandle  where we certainly don t have the kind of hot weather they get in miami or phoenix  but i find the air conditioning to be just adequate  i don t want the inside of the car to be frigid anyway  and with only moderately hot summer weather  the air conditioner is ok  it is adequate  it just seems such a shame to me that they could build this wonderful car with the posh seats and beautiful styling  and then put in an air conditioner that is just not in the same league with the rest of the car  surely the ones they put on the market to sell in the south have different and better systems in them  this a c is just rather disappointing like a couple of other posters here  i would like more cup holders  and maybe in metal rather than plastic in the front  where we use them a lot i would recommend this car to anyone who wants a smooth ride with ease of handling in a car whose watchword is  reliability  i would not recommend it to people who want really frigid air conditioning  for those buying in hot climates  i would say  take it for a long ride in the heat of the day and test that a c out before you buy  ,like keep cars quite long time hard since volkswagens last couple years go test drive everything appeal us educate finally purchase blandly loyal seem car money time pass design year refreshingly new like first test drive felt heavier jest golf use wheel mean smoother ride smaller wheel first car large would buy much leg room head room seat comfortable offer drive pass sell buy cylinder standard transmission model heat leather seat never heat seat think boy gimmick well unless weather quite warm heat seat great even moderately cool day feel good get warm seat even turn soon item make world difference comfort level people ride us impress pass light aquamarine call elegant green turn head beautiful soft shade also rate back seat

63,auto, i am renting dodge stratus because one of our vehicles is in the shop  i have to say that i m completely torn on whether or not i like it  the es that i m driving does have a very sporty appearance and i like the white gauges  the only thing i don t like about the outside appearance is the hubcaps  they look terrible  i haven t done a lot of homework on this car so i don t know whether or not the car even comes with aluminum wheels or what the wheels look like if they do inside the car  i don t feel like it s really that comfortable  i absolutely hate the tilt wheel mechanism  i think it s cheap and a pain  the seats are very weird feeling  i don t know what to think of them really  they have good lower  and upper back support  but somewhere in the middle there isn t any  what s that about the legroom is very tight  i m 6 0 quot  and don t have many problems with cars but the stratus is small  i commute 120 miles a day and i m really not comfortable  i ve been in worse cars   my wife s old geo storm  but not many  it s pretty cramped i don t like the controls for the stereo because they are little hard to reach  especially when you have to keep your eyes on the road  you have to eject the tape in order to listen to the radio and learning how to set the presets for fm2 takes awhile to figure out  the dome light turns off when you shut the door not when you turn the key the trunk looks like it s pretty big  the door opens nice and wide but you have to do all the work  if you pop the trunk from inside  the only thing that happens is the latch releases  you have to reach up over the expanse of the trunk opening to open and close it  i was being a little lazy today and only opened the trunk halfway  what resulted is that my wife ended up smacking her head on the door also  the button to release the rear seat back is a little out of the way  you have to stretch across to the middle in order to get this to work  come on daimler chrysler  is it too much to ask for two buttons  i mean this car is above  15k  spend a little the actual drive experience of the car is pretty good  it s got plenty of power  the only thing i don t like about this is that whenever i set the cruise control  the car tends to want to jump up a couple miles per hour  i ll set it for 65 and the car will cruise at 67 or 68  it seems to be a little high maintenance  also  to cancel the cruise control you have to practically slam on the brakes  most cars you just lightly tap but not the stratus i know that it has a cancel button on the steering wheel  but who remembers that  i have driven no other car by any other manufacturer that has that feature  i usually end up trying to turn cruise on using that button anyway i m not at all impressed with the air conditioning  it takes forever to cool the car down  our dog  grimm  the great dane  rides to and from work with us and he has done nothing but pant to and from work  our car has a couple vents in the back seat  but even so it takes a lot to cool that car down as far as my overall impression of the car  i m torn  there s things i like on it  but there s enough that i don t like that i wouldn t buy one  the car is ok  not something you cruise town in and say   quot hey  look at what i just bought quot  people could care less to get this car to look cool would take new wheels and tires  preferably low profile  and tint  this probably wouldn t look good on the maroon one i m driving though br br  ,rent dodge status one vehicles shop say completely tear whether like es drive sport appearance like white gauge thing like outside appearance hubcaps look terrible do lot homework car know whether car even come aluminium wheel wheel look like inside car feel like really comfortable absolutely hate tilt wheel mechanism think cheap pain seat weird feel know think really good lower upper back support somewhere middle bedroom tight quit many problems cars status small commune miles

dome light turn shut door turn key trunk look like pretty big door open nice wide work pop trunk inside thing happen latch release reach expanse trunk open open close little lazy today open trunk halfway result wife end smack head door also button release rear seat back little way stretch across middle order get work come dimmler chrysler much ask two button mean car spend little actual drive

practically slam rake cars lightly tap status know cancel button sneer wheel remember drive car manufacturer feature usually end try turn cruise use button anyway impress air condition take forever

64,camera, i ve always thought that digital cameras were one of the most important  147killer apps 148 of the technological age  but it has taken until now for the technology to advance enough and produce a product that has the quality and features to truly replace your typical 35mm point and shoot camera  the d510 zoom from olympus is a perfect example of such a product now i ll be honest  i didn t do a whole lot of research before buying my new toy  i knew enough about digital cameras to recognize the features that set them apart  but i had not done any specific research on this camera  but being the gear head i am  when i discovered this gem at a severely reduced clearance price i snatched it up  i knew at that time that olympus made some very nice cameras in both traditional and digital formats  my impulses on this one seemed to be right on  i have been using the camera for several weeks now  and am incredibly impressed with the convenience a quality digital camera can provide  the camera is a 2 1 mega pixels  this is basically all the quality you need for almost any application  pictures for the web turn out great  printed pictures in 4x6 and 5x7 look amazing  you can even stretch it to 8x10 without much of a major impact  1600 x 1200 pictures are produced by most settings  but you can cut down the size to increase the room for pictures  the 3x optical and 9x digital is something that is fairly hard to find in a camera in this price range  if your in the camera business  you know that olympus makes great quality lens  you ll know the a better quality lens will create a better picture  these hold true with the d510  if you do not know the difference between optical and digital zoom  optical is the physical adjustment of the lens to get a closer picture  digital simply takes the picture then crops and resizes it to the desired zoom  this is only useful if you want a bigger picture and in most cases  the quality is decreased  3x optical is more then enough for my use  the digital zoom is nice to have but i don t use it much because i can crop if necessary using software on my pc  a beautiful feature olympus includes is the ability to toggle the use of digital zoom  the zoom button is simply a rocker switch located next to the shutter button  if your using the lcd screen as a view finder  you will notice it will display a visual guide showing how much zoom is currently being applied  this guide also shows when you are making use of digital zoom or just optical zoom  another small feature  but it illustrates the thought that was put into this design the camera has a host of other features that set it apart from others  usb auto connect gives you an amazing amount of flexibility and allows windows to recognize the camera as an external hard drive and lets your simply drag and drop the files you want  when you combine this with windows xp s digital camera wizard  you couldn t ask for anything easier  this also allows you to use this camera as a card reader for any of your smart media cards  speaking of smart media cards  the camera includes a 8mb card in box  which allows for just fewer than 20 high quality shots  turn down the quality slightly and get in upwards of 50 the ability to plug your camera into a video input on a tv is a great addition to the already complete feature set  when your on a trip and don t have the ability to get a hold of a computer for a few minutes to view your pictures  simply plug in the standard rca output cable and connect it to any tv  an instant slideshow  olympus was nice enough to include this cable in the package  kudos to you olympus the quicktime movie capture feature allows you to take short movie clips  25 seconds long  the length of time and lack of audio capture makes this almost pointless  but i have found that i have used it for recording lab results in various classes at school the d 510 looks great on paper  but how does it perform in the real world opening the box gives displays various documents including your user manual and software  it has two cables  usb and video out  a set of nimh batteries  a 8mb card  a wristband and the camera itself  everything you need to get going is there  although the inclusion of an ac adapter would have been appreciated the actual camera is somewhat bulky compared to smaller models offered by hp  canon  and fuji  the newer d520 shares similar specifications but is almost half the depth of the d510 and does not retain the solid of the d510  the d510 case feels similar to brushed aluminium giving it a professional feel and style  it still fits into a pocket  on my rather large pants  but is better suited to remain in a case in a purse or backpack the pictures that come out of the camera are bright and vivid and i 146ve printed many in a variety of sizes  one of my pictures recently won 2nd place in a photo contest  picture  land of the living sky available at www barndoorfanclub org gallery twilight twilight html  the variety of shutter speed and aperture settings can be useful for someone with more experience in working with traditional slrs but i find that letting the camera automatically choose proper settings tends to produce excellent pictures  having said that  most of my low light pictures turned out less than impressive unless i played with the settings myself  the user manual includes a great guide on how to take the best pictures in a variety of situations and is worth reading through the software is not very useful  although it does allow you to take a number of shots and digitally  147stitch 148 them together to make a panorama  the results of the stitching function look very professional  i do most of my picture touch ups with jasc paint shop pro  i purchased two things with my camera  a 16mb smart media card and a small camera case  the 16mb allows me to capture 30 high quality pictures and then the 8mb can be used as a backup  the case protects the camera wherever i go and holds the usb cable and the extra memory card  nimh rechargeable batteries are on my list of things to pick up  as with most digital cameras  the d510 eats batteries  it is best to keep an extra set with the case as well  the battery life indicator only shows when the batteries are just about to die and will otherwise show a full charge until it 146s too late reasons to buy    powerful camera  2 1 mp  3x optical 9x digital  these features alone make it a desirable and very functional camera to have  low cost  the price point i 146ve seen for this camera makes it a viable option for a christmas present or just as a straight replacement for a 35mm for those new to digital cameras  impressive picture results  photos are bright and colourful  perfect for printing with a photo printer or getting professionally printed  it 146s just fun to use  the ability to take a picture of something at a get together  show it on a slideshow later that night  print out a copy for everyone there and then have it posted on a website the next day makes it fun to use things to watch out for  no camera case  best to pick one of these guys up  a good one can be had for under  20   software is weak  besides the ability to stitch panorama  the software was relatively weak and only useful as a photo viewer  something that windows xp does natively quite well  menu system  like other reviews  the menus do require some getting used to and i frequently have to refer back to the manual to track down specific features  some effort could be made to craft a less intimidating system conclusion the olympus d510 is a solid performer right of the box  with 2 1 mp and 3x optical zoom  it is the perfect replacement for a traditional 35mm or slr user experimenting with the new digital camera technology  although i do have some complaints about what is included camera and what isn 146t  they are relatively insignificant compared to the quality and usefulness of the camera overall  out of all the cameras i have tried out before and after the purchase of my d510  i am still impressed with the quality it produces  for the price  the d510 is best of class update i left my digital camera in my glove box by accident and over the course of two days was involved in some amateur rally racing  unfortunately i had not left the camera in its case and some of the pixels on the lcd preview

65,camera, let s begin with what comes out of the box the 4mp kodak ls443 camera with built in 16mb memory a docking station a battery ac adapter usb cable let me begin by saying  thanks kodak for not making us spend 100 extra dollars on things like the ac adapter and batteries which should be included in the first place this is my opinion on the camera  i love it for it s picture quality but i dislike it for not making me feel so great about myself when i take a picture  what does this mean well  when you see most cameras  the lcd is so crisp you can see if you goofed up the picture when you took it  therefore  you can quickly erase it and take another snapshot  with the ls443  you take a picture and the display on the screen isn t always all that great so you can t tell if it will be blurry or if there is too much light  keep this in mind when purchasing the camera  luckily  the picture quality is so top notch with this camera  i was able to foresee the lack of lcd display as far as the lens is concerned  it is a high end propriety schneider kreuznach variogon lens  there is a 3x optical zoom and 3 3x digital zoom for a total 10x zoom  in case you don t know how the zooms work  this is the difference optical zoom is a lens change causing a picture to be snapshotted as if you were physically closer to the object you are capturing  this means that the picture is as good quality as it would be if you were physically near the camera itself digital zoom is a hardware software approach to  zooming  in on a particular object at a certain distance  this type of zoom causes pixelation and destroys the overall quality of the picture  i don t even bother using digital zoom  i have it turned off  if you are looking to get a camera with great quality and zoom  only look at optical zoom  not digital  if you do look at digital  make sure that the camera is of high megapixels because you will need them when digitally zooming in the autofocus on the camera is great  you hold the button down half way and a little green box on the camera s lcd turns red  this means that the camera is focused and you can depress the button all the way to snapshot the picture  immediately after that the image is displayed on the screen and you are ready for your next shot fortunately  kodak took a huge step is combining the picture mode with the review mode  this means that you can hit the review button at any time in picture mode and it will show you all the pictures stored on the memory card  this helps a lot so you don t have to physically turn the camera into a different mode every time you want to review a picture  there is also an independent delete and share button available  that way you can immediately delete a picture if you don t like it  or you can hit the share button  which will allow you flag the picture to be emailed to a previously set list  via computer software  of possible recipients  as soon as you dock the camera  it will prompt you to email out the pictures you have flagged as far as the modes are concerned on the camera  it contains the following movie mode   this is with sound and it also plays back sound  the quality is not so great but you can t expect much from a digital camera  also  you don t have the ability to zoom in and out during recording since it will make noise and be captured auto mode  this mode is great for everyday pictures of people  objects at a reasonable distance  it takes the best picture dependent on the current situation  the autofocus is performed by an independent blue light which shines prior to the snapshot and focuses the camera sport mode  this is ideal for objects in motion and will increase the shutter speed thus trying to avoid blurriness macro mode  this is for objects that are closer than 28cm  flash is automatically disabled and this option works great  i ve used it many times  night time mode  this is great for night time when light is readily available  the shutter speed is decreased and hence more light is absorbed  however  this means that even a slight shake in your hand will output a blurry image  thus you need some sort of tripod when taking these types of pictures landscape mode  this sets the lens to infinite focus  there is no redbox greenbox to indicate focus  this mode works fantastic and i ve used it many times to take great pictures of scenery as far as the options are concerned on the camera itself  you have the ability to set it to multiple mode which will take up to 3 shots in a row  works great for objects in motion  you also have the ability to change the flash type to automatic  always on  red eye reduction or off  red eye reduction is a little weird since it flashes twice instead of flickering first and then flashing  this means your guests will assume that the picture was taken on the first flash and start to move right at the time the actual picture is taken  be careful of this and warn them ahead of time the pictures can be taken in color  black and white  or sephia  the olden days look there is control to increase or decrease white exposure  for snowy days or days there is too much or too little light there is the ability to set the quality of the picture  you can make it the full 4 megapixels  2 2 megapixels or  1 megapixel  with a 128mb card  you can take 103 pictures at best quality as far as the cards are concerned  this camera uses a secure digital   multimedia card  these are generally much more expensive than compact flash or smart media  however  it has 16mb of internal memory which is used once the card is filled  the camera comes with a docking station  when you place the camera on the docking station  it begins to charge and immediately allows you to transfer over pictures to your computer  charging time is about 2 hours which is much better than the sony dsc p71 which requires 13 hours  an excellent feature of the camera is that you can physically connect the same ac adapter and same usb that goes into the docking station  right into the side of the camera  this means you can transfer pics to any computer without carrying around the entire docking station  however  take note that the ac adapter  when plugged directly into the camera  will not charge it but will let you take infinite amount of pictures without a battery no matter where you  you will find the ac adapter costs much more and the battery charger is a standalone device  kodak simplifies our life by including all this in the package drawbacks of this camera also include the fact that there is no way to check the battery life unless it s dying in which a battery indicator comes on the lcd  usually you can take about 75 pictures with the lcd on and upto 300 pictures with the lcd off  be prepared to buy an extra battery  these batteries are proprietary and can only be bought in select places  luckily they are dirt cheap  you can get a battery additional wall charger great for travel  for about 25 dollars if you look around online  one other thing that i would love to have seen would have been an additional text lcd display which showed number of pics remaining  battery indicator and few other required options  this way you wouldn t have to have the lcd on most of the time  however  for the price  you can t expect to have everything i chose this camera because i wanted the quality of the pics to be great  not for just the features  what you are looking for is up to you  good luck with buying a digicam and i hope you are as satisfied as i was with my purchase  ,let begin come box today

67,auto, the audi allroad quattro  notice the lowercase  is an incredible vehicle that combines the luxury  power  speed  and finesse of a fine german sports sedan with the usability of a street smart suv after having spent the past 5 years driving a toyota corolla i decided to spend a little cash and  upgrade  my vehicle  i needed a vehicle that was large enough to hold all the music equipment i lug around but also one that was zippy enough that i could have fun in while cruising the florida landscape  i test drove various suv s from the bmw x5 to the acura mdx and while they were all nice  they didn t give me the sense of power and speed that i needed  enter the audi allroad the 250hp 2 6 v6 delivers smooth power no matter which gear and rpm i am in  i ve clocked 0 60 times on it at 6 5 seconds  this car really moves  it beats the other suv s  hands down  in terms of power and speed  i also love how useful the car is during city driving  the height adjustable suspension allows me to lower the car during high speed and city driving  this gives it a zippier and less truck like feel  however  if i need to go over a median or tree limb or something similar  i raise it to highest level and in a few seconds i have suv towering height  i recommend this car for anyone looking for a high quality  sports sedan with the practicality of an suv  the slightly high price gives you complete luxury inside  wood trim  leather  power everything  and audi has not forgotten anything in their design  the gas mileage is my only complaint with this fine vehicle  with the corolla i was getting 29 mpg city and now i am averaging 17 18  depending on how i drive  it s cleaner and more efficient than most suv s but i would recommend you go with a smaller suv  like the toyota rav4  if you re worried about gas consumption i ve had my allroad for almost two months with zero problems and extreme delight  for me  this vehicle is pure luxury utility speed  it s a perfect match for those looking for a fast  usable vehicle  ,audit abroad quatre notice lowercase incredible vehicle combine luxury power speed finesse fine german sport sedan liability street smart sun spend past years drive tooth coolly decide spend little cash upgrade vehicle need vehicle large enough hold music equipment leg around also one happy enough could fun bruise florida landscape test drive various sun bow acute mix nice give sense power speed need enter audit abroad deliver smooth power matter gear rum block time second car really move beat sun hand term power speed also love useful car city drive height adjustable suspension allow lower car high speed city drive give happier less truck like feel however need go median tree limb something similar raise highest level second sun tower height recommend car anyone look high quality sport sedan practically sun slightly high price give complete luxury inside wood trim leather power everything audit forget anything design gas mileage complaint fine vehicle coolly get pg city average depend drive cleaner efficient sun would recommend go smaller sun like tooth run worry gas consumption abroad almost two months zero problems extreme delight vehicle pure luxury utility speed perfect match look fast unable vehicle

71,camera, after doing research about digital cameras online  i went to best buy to try out cameras  my top two choices were a nikon coolpix 995 and a canon digital elph  but when i saw the olympus  i was hooked  i went home  read up on its features  and bought it the same day and what features convinced me  the 10x optical zoom is unparalleled in a camera of the c700 s size and cost  serious photographers can override any automatic setting  aperture  shutter speed  focus  white balance  and emulated iso setting  and it works with linux but nothing s perfect  my biggest complaints are that i had to spend an extra  55 to buy 4 nimh aa batteries and a 128mb smartmedia card  the bundled 8mb card only stores 16 pictures at the default settings  some people may also lament the 2 11 megapixel ccd  many cameras in this price range now have 3 3 mp some more details this camera is great for anyone from a novice up to a serious amateur  novices can use the camera as a simple point and shoot and get reasonably good pictures  serious hobbyists can tinker with the lighting  focus  and white balance and get more interesting pictures in a variety of settings  this is a  having your cake and eating it  too  situation  if you need to take a picture quickly  just hit the shutter button  if you want to get artistic or shoot in unusual lighting  everything s adjustable the user interface makes everything easy to get to  changing the aperture and shutter speed can be done with one button  changing the focus takes two  everything else is in a well laid out two level menu  you can pick three menu settings for top level access the camera takes aa batteries  giving me the choice of lithium  included  rechargeable  or alkaline in a pinch  i have two sets of rechargeables that i rotate  each lasts several days of normal use the c700 acts as a  usb mass storage  device  which means that it can run with any usb capable os  including win98  macos  and linux  the computer treats the camera as an external hard disk and can download 8 mb  16 25 pictures  in about 8 seconds i would very strongly recommend this camera to anyone who wants the flexibility of a digital slr in a  400  11 oz package one caveat  many of the cheaper vendors are selling either imported grey market cameras  which have no warranty and may not have english language menus  or are selling  bare  cameras without software  cables  batteries  or the 8mb smart card  make sure you buy the u s  retail box  ,research digital camera online go best buy try camera top two choice union coolpix canon digital saw polypus hook go home read feature buy day feature convince optical room unparalleled camera size cost serious photographer overrule automatic set aperture shutter speed focus white balance emulate iso set work line nothing perfect biggest complaints spend extra buy nigh batteries mb smartmedia card bundle mb card store picture default settings people may also lament megapixel cod many camera price range detail camera great anyone novice serious amateur novices use camera simple point shoot get reasonably good picture serious hobbyists tinker light focus white balance get interest picture variety settings cake eat situation need take picture quickly hit shutter button want get artistic shoot unusual light everything adjustable user interface make everything easy get change aperture shutter speed do one button change focus take two everything else well lay two level menu pick three menu settings top level access camera take batteries give choice lithium include rechargeable alkaline pinch two set rechargeables rotate last several days normal use act us mass storage device mean run us capable os include win face line computer treat camera external hard disk download mb picture second would strongly recommend camera anyone want flexibility digital sir oz package one cadet many cheaper vendor sell either import grey market camera warranty may english language venus sell bare camera without software table batteries mb smart card make sure buy retail box
72,camera, i have used 35mm cameras in the past and some other digital cameras and the kodak ls443 puts all those other ones to shame  once you start taking pictures then you will know what i m talking about  when you first download the pictures to your computer  you will be amazed at the picture quality and how vibrant the colors look  also the camera comes with the docking station that makes the transfer of pictures very fast and easy now for the review b  picture quality and memory   first off  the picture quality  the camera has three settings for picture quality  at the highest setting the pictures are very close to what a regular 35mm film camera would do  also at this setting you can get some great 4 by 6 or 8 by 10 prints  the specifications say you can get up to 20 by 30 prints but i have not tried those  i think the recommended size is up to 11 by 14  with those three sizes this camera is perfect for most users  the highest setting of the camera is 4 mega pixels  the second setting is 2 2 mega pixels and the last setting is 1 mega pixel  i mostly used the 4 mp setting when taking most of my pictures but i have used the 1 mp setting when i want to send emails to people  at the highest setting the pictures are about 1 megabyte in size so i would recommend buying a memory card of at least 128 mb  i personally bought a 256 mb card and with that i can take over 200 pictures at the highest quality setting and about nineteen minutes of video in movie mode  the difference in price between the 128 and the 256 mb card is not that much  the actual specifications on how many pictures you can take depending on the card size can be seen at the kodak site b  controls   in some reviews that i read some people have said that the shutter button is spongy and it is hard to control  this was not the case with me  to get the camera to take the best pictures possible  you would hold down the shutter button half way and then the camera would automatically set the focus and the flash settings  when it does that then you just press the shutter button all the way down to take the picture  some people said that it takes a long time to auto focus but this is not the case  the camera is ready to take the picture quite quickly the zoom is quite good  i just recommend that you don t use the digital aspect of it  only the optical  i took a few pictures using the digital zoom and the picture quality dropped off somewhat the camera operates in several modes  the only one that i haven t used yet is the night mode so i cannot comment on it but all the other modes do exactly what they say they can do  for example  my little nephew was running around  so i put the camera in sport mode and the pictures came out great  very focused with no blurring  this is another thing that other people have complained about and i don t see why  that is why the camera has all these different modes  so you can get the best pictures during different situations the camera also has a lot of manual controls for setting up the exposure  white balance  where to focus  iso and other things so there is a lot of stuff that novice picture takers can play around with  most of the time i have the camera set in automatic mode  but to get all the other features to work right you just have to experiment and take pictures in different conditions to see what works best  the manual guide of the camera explains each function pretty well so you can pick up all the features pretty quickly every time you switch to a new mode  there is a quick explanation of what it does so this makes the camera very easy to operate b  lcd   one of the cons of this camera is the lcd  first of all the picture quality in the lcd is not good at all  when i took a few pictures i thought they were all coming out bad when i viewed them using the review feature of the camera  the photos don t look clear and the colors look a bit off  that is a different case when you see the pictures on a computer  then you can really see what the camera can do  also  i was taking some pictures outdoors  and you can barely see the image on the lcd screen  also at night you can t see anything on the screen  it would have been nice if they would have added controls to the lcd screen to change the contrast or the brightness to adjust to these conditions  these drawbacks are not that bad and can be overlooked because of the picture quality of the camera  ,use mm camera past digital camera today put ones shame start take picture know talk first download picture computer amaze picture quality

74,camera, this is an excellent camera technically  however recent experiences i have encountered have led me to change my mind  the only problem is that there are only a few models available in the market in this category  please see my previous review it ranks high in lens quality  performance  ease of use  and manual override capabilities the lack of a swivel lcd screen is very sadly omitted by minolta  the ability to switch between manual and automatic focus by accidentally touching the button is a poor design feature as is the placement of the neck strap ring over the cf door the unadvertised apo shutdown feature is really a sad feature  minolta should really look into this and either remove it or advertise it so that you are not caught using it while deleting an image at the same time  the end result for me was the corruption of all my images in my cf card  which caused me to spend   to recapture the lost images  the attitude received in the repair department was a real shocker to me  i have never encountered this in my life as a consumer  at canon i have always been treated as a consumer with respect and professionalism  as a result i will never buy another one of their products in the future  ,excellent camera technically however recent experience encounter lead change mind problem model available market category please see previous review rank high lens quality performance ease use manual overrule capabilities lack wive lead screen sadly omit minorca ability switch manual automatic focus accidentally touch button poor design feature placement neck strap ring cf door advertise ago shutdown feature really sad feature minorca really look either remove advertise catch use meet image time end result corruption image cf card cause spend recapture lose image attitude receive repair department real shock never encounter life consumer canon always treat consumer respect professionalism result never buy another one products future
75,camera, i have now owned the olympus d 400z camera for over a year  15 months  and without a doubt  can say it s a wonderful camera since i purchased this camera  they have come out with later models  such as the 450  460  and i think now it s up to 490  they all still use the same lens system to my knowledge  and smart media cards for photo storage  the only difference is that the newer models now use rechargable batteries  and the 490 now also offers a  quot quicktime quot  movie mode so you can take short movies  the d 400z does not offer a movie mode  but it s still a great camera the 3x optical zoom works well on the d 400z  the additional 2x digital zoom allows you to bring items in even closer  the photos are always clear  and show great detail  there is even a  quot panoramic quot  mode that allows you to take a series of photos side by side  and then with the included software allows you to  quot stitch quot  them together to make one long  panoramic shot  i ll have to say as well  that taking a number of these panoramic shots  you cannot notice any lines where the photos are stitched together in most cases  great feature  you can let the camera take automatically adjusted shots for you  or  you can control the brightness and more with manual settings  i have compared the photos that my olympus has taken to friend s more expensive digital cameras  a sony mavicas and a fuji  and mine were by far better on screen  and in print this particular model came with a  quot camedia floppy disk adapter quot  which allows you to insert your smart media card into it and use it through your floppy drive to download photos  this is an added plus since the olympus only includes a serial cable for other types of downloading   a slow process and battery drainer  the floppy adapter can be purchased in stores as a separate item for use with any camera that uses smart media cards  by the way regardless of which 400 series olympus camera you re thinking about  they re well worth the money  added 12 5 00   sample photos i finally got off my butt and did it  follow the link below  and you ll go to my yahoo photo page  where you ll find sample photos taken with the olympus  and a couple of other cameras i ve used  i ll add more photos over time  but there s a few on there now http photos yahoo com greg30127   ,own polypus camera year months without doubt say wonderful camera since purchase camera come later model think still use lens system knowledge smart media card photo storage difference newer model use rechargable batteries also offer quit quicktime quit movie mode take short move offer movie mode still great camera optical room work well additional digital room allow bring items even closer photo always clear show great detail even quit panorama quit mode allow take series photo side side include software allow quit stitch quit together make one long panorama shoot say well take number panorama shots notice line photo stitch together case great feature let camera take automatically adjust shots control brightness manual settings compare photo polypus take friend expensive digital camera sonya magical full mine far better screen print particular model come quit camelia floppy disk adapt quit allow insert smart media card use floppy drive download photo add plus since polypus include aerial cable type download slow process battery drain floppy adapt purchase store separate item use camera use smart media card way regardless series polypus camera think well worth money add sample photo finally get butt follow link go yakov photo page find sample photo take polypus couple camera use add photo time http photo yakov com grow

77,auto, i bought the 1995 ls integra sedan new  after 84 000 highway miles  this car can only be described as a gem of first class proportions  i highly recommend the 5 speed  as you gain power  control  mileage  and the fun to drive factor first  i have not had one single thing ever go wrong with the car  it has driven flawlessly from day one  without a single non routine maintenance repair  other than routine oil changes  and service  i have had no shop visit  i have done routine maintenance and had one set of front disc pads replaced  to this day  it rides  accelerates  handles  and behaves precisely as well as it did when i drove it off the dealer s lot the ls is a great performer and great fun to drive  don t believe what you read about how the integra gsr outperforms the ls  in everyday driving  and even quite challenging driving you won t tell the difference  the fact is  when you overlay the torque power acceleration curves for the 140 hp ls vs  the 170 hp gsr  they are virtually identical until you get well above 5500 rpm s  that s really where the vtec advantages of the gsr kick in  now if you are out racing at 100 mph   on a routine basis  then the several 6 or 7 thousand   more for the gsr will be justified  in everyday routine driving however  even hard and fast driving   which is what i do  there simply is no substantive difference i love the handling on this gem  and commute a winding  demanding road  80 miles daily  i simply never get tired of the  quot fun quot  factor that an otherwise torturous drive  produces from this car  comfort is also a big plus with excellent fit and finish  well laid out dash  strong air conditioner  comfy seats  and excellent visibility  mileage for all this power and fun  unbeatable  i consistently get 28 to 34 mpg on 89 octane with this screamer  and i drive it pretty hard  complaints  none of substance  my only nits to pick would be that interior road noise is slightly higher than more  quot sedate quot  sedans provide  wind noise around door seals is a bit higher than for most sedans  and the stock premium stereo could be better for those into audiophile quality sounds systems  beyond those rather minor  quot sound quot  related caveats  i have simply never owned a car i loved more than this one  and probably never will again  if they redesign the fun out of this  as so many other manufacturers have done br br  ,buy integral sedan new highway miles car describe gem first class proportion highly recommend speed gain power control mileage fun drive factor first one single thing ever go wrong car drive fearlessly day one without single non routine maintenance repair routine oil change service shop visit do routine maintenance one set front disc pad replace day rid accelerate candle behave precisely well drive dealer lot great performer great fun drive believe read integral gr outperform everyday drive even quite challenge drive tell difference fact overlay true power acceleration curve vs gr virtually identical get well rum really ten advantage gr kick race may routine basis several thousand gr justify everyday routine drive however even hard fast drive simply substantive difference love handle gem commune wind demand road miles daily simply never get tire quit fun quit factor otherwise tortuous drive produce car comfort also big plus excellent fit finish well lay dash strong air condition come seat excellent visibility mileage power fun unbearable consistently get pg ocean scream drive pretty hard complaints none substance pick would interior road noise slightly higher quit sedate quit sedan provide wind noise around door seal bite higher sedan stock premium sterno could better audiophile quality sound systems beyond rather minor quit sound quit relate cavern simply never own car love one probably never design fun many manufacturers do br
78,camera, when office depot offered a free 64mb smart media card with the purchase of the olympus d 380 camera  i didn t hesitate a minute  before the day was out  i was the proud owner of this camera  i haven t had a digital camera since i purchased a toshiba m 4 last year  unfortunately  the newer versions of the m 4 didn t come with a serial cable  and i resisted buying one for the outrageous price of  45 until it was too late  they discontinued offering it  i got rid of the m 4  last week i finally bit the bullet and upgraded my windows 95 to windows 98se  which then activated my usb port  i now felt that i could purchase almost any digital camera and be able to transfer pictures to my computer   yeah  right i i read all the instructions that came with the d 380 and took a few sample pictures  the camera was very easy to use  and the only thing i disliked was that the camera was too small to hold comfortably  i imagine that one could easily get used to the small size b the good  this camera takes great pictures  it is point and shoot  for the most part  it boasts 2 0 megapixels  a focus free glass lens  4 5mm  f4  and can take short movies  it produces up to 1600x1208 pixel images  the camera weighs in at 6 7 ounces and is 4 9 x2 56 x1 6  in size  because it is small  it can fit in a pocket or purse  the lens cover is permanently attached to the front of the camera  when you slide the lens cover off the lens  the camera automatically turns on  and when you slide the cover back over the lens  the camera turns off the d 380 uses removable smart media cards  but also has 1mb of internal memory as a back up  you can change the resolution of pictures while they are still in the camera  you can merge photos to produce panorama shots  there is a built in flash with 6 modes and red eye reduction  the camera comes with a usb cable  wrist strap  instruction manual  and warranty card b the not so good  the d 380 comes with only an 8mb smart media card unfortunately  there is no optical zoom  but there is a 2 5 digital zoom the camera runs on 4 aa alkaline batteries  which are included  it does  not  come equipped with rechargeable batteries or a battery charger  any aa batteries may be used except manganese batteries b the ugly  the camera arrived with camedia master software 4 0 for management of your pictures  in all the large print  it claims that this software is compatible with windows 98se  alas  if you get down to the very small print  you will see that there are about four operating systems that will not work with this software  windows 98se  upgrade  is one of these exceptions i will admit that i saw this warning before i installed the software  but all my life i have been a daredevil  throwing caution to the winds  this time was no exception  the software loaded without any problems  and i was able to download a picture from the camera via the usb port  the quality of the picture was excellent  hurray  i thought i was beating the odds yet another time  that was before i decided to move the picture to my paper port archives  when i clicked on my paper port  where  all  of my photos are located  i got the following error messages   a device attached to the system is not functioning  and  the shell32 dll file is linked to missing export shlwapi dll shreggetusvaluea well  i thought  perhaps i just might delete the shlwapi file  and all would be well  however  when i took a look at the shlwapi file  oh my  it had so much unreadable stuff in it that i quickly gave up that idea even after i uninstalled the camedia software  i could not access paper port and gain access to my photo archives  now i have to  once again  re format my computer from square one  i am getting pretty good at that so  back i went to office depot and reluctantly returned that nifty little camera  sigh  ,office depot offer free mb smart media card purchase polypus camera hesitate minute day proud owner camera digital camera

79,camera, since purchasing my sony mvc fd92 digital camera  i have only used a regular camera maybe twice  i still have a roll of film in it that i need to finish this camera is   easy b  to use  i was taking pictures and video within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box  i cannot recall a purchase that i have been happier with the only thing that i do not like about it  is how it takes the picture  you click the button  it flashes and then takes the picture  my toddler doesn t stand sit still that long  but it is making me a better amateur photographer this camera uses both the memory stick technology and 3 1 2 inch floppy discs   both sold separately  i have not seen how many files i can get on a 32mb memory stick yet  but i have had 40 on the stick and still had more room it comes with a usb adapter so you can hook it up to your computer and download the pictures  or you can copy from your memory stick to your floppy and just stick the floppy in your computer  the latter is a little more cumbersome  but works great when your computer doesn t have a usb port there is a color lcd display to view what you are taking and to do a play back  you can delete pictures that you do not like while they are still on the camera  no more wasting money on processing pictures with someone s eyes closed or when they have turned their head on you there are 3 4 settings that you can use to take your pictures also  there is normal  black and white  sepia and i think one more  i have not tried any of these settings yet  i have only had my camera a couple of months with the digital camera  you can either upload your pictures to a number of online photo places for printing or  depending on the printer you have  print them yourself  the latter is the option i choose  the only way people can tell that i have printed them myself is if they touch them  i use regular ink jet paper  but they turn out fabulous i bought this camera because i wanted to be able to share pictures and little videos of my child  and any children to come  with family members who don t live near us  and being an employee of sony  i get a discount   6 20 01   update  i have found one other thing that i do not particularly like about this camera  the 5 second videos only look good when viewed on the camera itself  i have a little video of my son and a new monitor  i can make out his features  but not very well  ,since purchase sonya mac ff digital camera use regular camera maybe twice still roll film need finish camera easy use take picture video within minutes take box recall purchase happier thing like take picture click button flash take picture toller stand sit still long make better amateur photographer camera use memory stick technology inch floppy discs sell separately see many file get mb memory stick yet stick still room come us adapt hook computer download picture copy memory stick floppy stick floppy computer latter little cumbersome work great computer us port color lead display view take play back delete picture like still camera waste money process picture someone eye close turn head settings use take picture also normal black white septa think one try settings yet camera couple months digital camera either unload picture number online photo place print depend printer print latter option choose way people tell print touch use regular ink jet paper turn fabulous buy camera want able share picture little video child children come family members live near us employee sonya get discount update find one thing particularly like camera second video look good view camera little video son new monitor make feature well

81,camera, digital cameras are very much like computers by now  wait six months and you brand new camera will be topped and out featured by the new release  but much like my computer  i want something that works well  is dependable  and gives me what i need  in this case  i want an easy and convenient camera that takes good pictures  the olympus d 490 zoom is ideal because not only does it give me what i want  but it didn t cost a ridiculous amount as well first and foremost i should mention a couple of elements that are always talked about when addressing digital cameras and that i needed to keep in mind while shopping around  said elements are megapixels and storage megapixels  by now  digital cameras are coming out with 4  megapixel cameras for around  1000 dollars  i m sure in 5 years they ll be  300  just like 2 megapixel cameras went through not so long ago   megapixels  are essentially the number of pixels that make up your pictures  and the higher the number of megapixels  the more fine detailed your pictures are  1 megapixel cameras are the flashbulb wind up cameras of the 21st century to your average store clerk by now  and though i d like to think the 2 1 olympus d 490 zoom isn t yet  it probably will be in no time  but unless you re a forensics detective charged with analyzing evidence photos  the 2 1 megapixels crank out huge  gorgeous pictures that will suit any occasion  i ve seen higher quality cameras  results and yes  they are better  but only in the same way platinum is  better  than gold storage  there s different ways to save your pictures in memory to place on your computer  some take regular 3 5 inch floppy discs  sonys take their special memory sticks  and several take sandisk s smartmedia cards which are a little smaller than two postage stamps yet store a lot more than the floppy kind and are much more common than sony s specialized memory storage system  the d 490 zoom comes with an 8m card and you can purchase larger ones for a semi expensive price  but keep in mind  for this and all purchases concerning this camera  that if you count enough pictures  you will end up saving money if you consider all film and developing purchases you won t ever bother with again incidentally  for more information concerning both of these slightly tricky elements and several others you really should give thought to before buying a digital camera  seek more information on the  net  or what i did  which is study the large article in a semi recent consumer reports magazine that greatly helped me out as for the camera itself  i ve been very happy with it  it does crank out high quality pictures  you can use the typical view finder  which saves power  or the screen built into the back  it has a convenient flash with several options  anti red eye  long distance for darkened scenery  even  long distance anti red eye  i can scan all pictures as soon as i take them  take multiple shots if i think one hasn t come out well and delete any that didn t  and best of all can take countless stupid  innane  and goofy pictures that i normally would ve never  wasted film on  it has a nifty little zoom that can also be set to digital though to be frank i ve heard negative things about digital zoom so it s at the end of the list of things i ve yet to learn about the camera  and that leads me to one of the only drawbacks with so many options comes a rather complicated on screen menu  and it displays on menu while the camera s on and another when off which can be confusing  but my opinion is that you have to take the bad with the good  you could have less complex menus with a camera that has less functionality  while pointing out the negatives  the d 490 zoom does not include an ac adapter  nor does it have a usb connector  also  regular aa batteries aren t supposed to be used with it  there s a special kind designed for high end electronics which i didn t know until i had already purchased it  finally  the only way to turn off the camera is to close the sliding door but it s dangerously close to the telescoping lens which makes me wonder if they could have designed it a bit better  otherwise  i m completely out of  cons  but i m being purposefully critical finally  i am a big believer that this camera will pay for itself after i take enough pictures with it  i  splurged  on this purchase  buying the camera on sale but also buying special rechargable batteries made for digital cameras  the recharger  and a  flashpath  sandisk floppy disk adapter to make transferring the pictures from camera to computer infinitely easier   that s the next critique i ll crank out  all together it cost me around  650  i figure that after 1000 pictures the camera will have paid for itself  i ve only had it for less than two months  and it s already 1 5th of the way there considering everything  the olympus d 490 zoom is a great product  it s dependable  solidly built  offers loads of functions and fun to use  it deserves a solid four stars and definite consideration if you re thinking of buying a digital camera  and for the freedom and fun digital cameras offer  the entire concept deserves a gleaming five stars  ,digital camera much like computers wait six months brand new camera top feature new release much like computer want something work well dependable give need case want easy convenient camera

82,camera,   describe your experience using this product when i use this camera it is mainly to take pictures of my friends and special lifetime events that go on like going to parties or other fun functions  i use it completely in lieu of a normal 35 mm camera and it operates just as easily  i think its great because on the little screen in the back you can tell if you blinked in the picture  and if you did immediately retake the picture so you dont have to wait to get the film developed to find out that the picture was horrible because you blinked or put your head in a weird position and got a double chin etc  it is great for that purpose  when i try to take pictures of my dogs with it though  is where i found that it isnt so great they arent the most patient of subjects  they often will not hold the pose as long as a human so the picture is all a matter of luck    why did you buy this product i got the camera as a gift for graduating from college so i could document my travels after graduation  it is perfect for that  i took it with me everywhere and have great quality pictures from everywhere i went  it was lightweight and easy to carry around with me everywhere so i didnt worry about it at all  in fact  i had it in my small purse and didnt even remember most of the time because it was so lightweight    what do you love about this product obviously so far you can tell that i love the picture quality  and the lightweight and ease of use  the camera is great for amateur photography  or just documenting your life    what do you hate what i dont like about the camera is that i have had it for a short amount of time and have had to buy the batteries for it 4 times already  of course some were completely my fault like for leaving it plugged into my computer overnight so it drained the batteries keeping itself awake  or when it opened the slide front when i didnt have it in a bag in my purse so the camera was just sitting there waiting to take pictures but just the same it is irritating because the local radio shack doesnt carry the batteries in stock so i have to order them the other thing i dont like is the inability to zoom into things really far away  one night  i saw a picture of the moon that was absolutely amazing and wanted to take a picture of it to use as my background on my monitor  i took the picture and got it home only to realize that all i had was really sky  the moon was so tiny that you couldnt even tell it was really there  ,describe experience use product use camera mainly take picture friends special lifetime events go like go party fun function use completely lieu normal mm camera operate easily think great little screen back tell blink picture immediately retake picture dont wait get film develop find picture horrible blink put head weird position get double chin etc great purpose try take picture dog though find great agent patient subject often hold pose long human picture matter luck buy product get camera gift granulate college could document travel granulation perfect take everywhere great quality picture everywhere go lightweight easy carry around everywhere worry fact small purse even remember time lightweight love product obviously far tell love picture quality lightweight ease use camera great amateur photography document life hate dont like camera short amount time buy batteries time already course completely fault like leave plug computer overnight drain batteries keep awake open slide front bag purse camera sit wait take picture irritate local radio shock carry batteries stock order thing dont like inability room things really far away one night saw picture moon absolutely amaze want take picture use background monitor take picture get home realize really sky moon tiny even tell really

85,auto, hi  i m peter and i am a car enthusiast  i have read about this car and driven it a lot despite the fact that i still don t own one  what is great about this car is that it is the most reliable car on the road in my opinion  mercedes has always been known as a reliable car company but they took it a step further when they created this sleek new e class  another great aspect about this car is that it is also safe  it has the side airbags and head curtains for added safety  when i was looking into the cars in this price range  i was stuck between getting the bmw 5 series and this e class  i really liked the power and luxury of the bmw but i also liked how the mercedes drove  each of these cars are excellent but what struck me to be strange was how much more spartan the mercedes was than the bmw  i could easily tell that mercedes put all of their energy into making this car from the engine and body out  while the bmw focused more on the interior comfort  i know that when you go yo look at this car  you will see the  40 000  price tag and think that it is too expensive  don t  whatever you do  look at this car as just a car  this is an investment  what i suggest to do is to get the most out of this car  if you opt for an e 300  was not made in 2000 but will be back in 2001 or 2002  you will get a much better value  this car will last as long as you  you can buy it when you are 16 and drive it when you re 50  just think of how many times you would have to buy a new car if you consistently bought a ford focus  also  this car with the deisel engine has a great gas mileage  for these reasons  get an e 300 diesel and save money on your next car br br  ,hi peter car enthusiast read car drive lot despite fact still one great car reliable car road opinion precede always know reliable car company take step create sleek new class another great aspect car also safe side airbags head curtain add safety look cars price range stick get bow series class really like power luxury bow also like precede drive cars excellent strike strange much smarten precede bow could easily tell precede put energy make car engine body bow focus interior comfort know go look car see price tag think expensive whatever look car car investment suggest get car opt make back get much better value car last long buy drive think many time would buy new car consistently buy ford focus also car vessel engine great gas mileage reason get diese save money next car br
86,auto, i have to be honest with you   perhaps i m biased  but i ve always been a mercedes girl  from my dad s first 240d to his 380 sl  i was in heaven he s just turned in his suv and was on the prowl for something fun  fast and preferably a convertible  we looked at everything from a porsche boxter  audi s  bmw s  saabs and beyond  as a last resort  dad headed out to the mercedes dealer  though he d always been in love with mercedes  he didn t think this car was the answer to say that joy shone from his face the first time he drove it was an understatement  he had found his nirvana it came in the form of a silver 2001 mercedes slk380 i had been with him in his vehicle pursuit  we d tried everything  i found the boxter fun  but we lost out on that one  i thought the bmw s were very disappointing  we tried a 6 speed and an automatic and both lacked any of the power or pizazz i had expected  the saab s were nice  but a little too family oriented  this mercedes was the first two seater i had actually found comfy  the seats hug your back no matter what size you may be  there is an amazing amount of leg room  i m 5 10  which is always a requirement in any car i either drive or sit as a passenger the controls were a little hard to decipher at first passing glance  but the little flip chart they provide with the car answers any and all questions i find it interesting that they sell the cd changer as an option  and of course the car can only have the mercedes changer  nothing like protecting their interests  but the addition of the changer was a good choice the hardtop is a great thing  the prior 380sl we owned had the detachable hardtop which was  to say the least  cumbersome and difficult to store  the hardtop provides great durability  no replacing the top on this car  and gives a sleeker line than some other convertibles in it s class an amazing option that i had never heard of before was the automatic transmission that could also be driven as a 5 speed  i m not any sort of expert on cars  so pardon me while i still wipe the look of  wow  i didn t know they could do that  off my face  it s a nice option as you can choose the kind of drive you want i found the drive solid and stable  it hugged the curves and flew down any straightaways  the only few drawbacks are as follow 1  when the top is down  you can almost completely forget about the trunk  sure  you could fit a few bags in there  but don t expect to throw the top down while on a cross country journey  unless  of course  you pack light 2  the netting behind the drivers head can cause some sight impairment while backing up with the top down  and it s a pain to take it off and put it back on later  overall for the price tag  i found this car to be the best value in it s class  it s sporty  it s elegant and it s classy  plus it comes with a great warranty and gets decent mileage  ,honest perhaps base always precede girl dad first heaven turn sun prowl something fun fast preferably convertible look everything porch boxer audit bow stab beyond last resort dad head precede dealer though always love precede think car answer say joy shine face first time drive understatement find nirvana come form silver precede silk vehicle pursuit try everything find boxer fun lose one think bow disappoint try speed automatic lack power pizazz expect scab nice little family torment precede first two seat actually find come seat hug back matter size may amaze amount leg room always requirement car either drive sit passenger control little hard decipher first pass glance little lip chart provide car answer question find interest sell change option course car precede change nothing like protect interest addition change good choice wardrop great thing prior own detachable wardrop say least cumbersome difficult store wardrop provide great disability replace top car give sleeker line convertible class amaze option never hear automatic transmission could also drive speed sort expert cars pardon still wipe look know could face nice option choose kind drive want find drive solid stable hug curve fly straightaways drawback follow top almost completely forget trunk sure could fit bag expect throw top cross country journey unless course pack light get behind drivers head cause sight impairment back top pain take put back later overall price tag find car best value class sport elegant class plus come great warranty get decent mileage

88,auto, i purchased my 1991 accord used a year ago this past april  this is my fourth honda product  i purchased all the others with well over 100 000 miles on them and they all ran flawlessly  and i got each of them to over 200 000 before selling not scrapping them  this specimen had 121 000 on it then and is pushing 155 000 now  i snapped it up right away because it was the only accord wagon i d ever seen with a 5 speed  despite a few character flaws i attribute to previous owner bone headedness  such as a broken antenna  cheesily tinted windows  and rusty rear quarters  a flaw common to all older hondas but easily preventable with periodic inspection and clearing of the rear fender drains  i am a musician and i have loaded my accord to the gills with  heavy  musical gear  it has never complained and  even loaded down  will return 25 mpg  it handles great  and  with a 5 speed  is surprisingly quick  i have had my share of fun dusting the occasional slammed import or focus and enjoyed immensely the look on the driver s face as he she watches my rear bumper bounce up and down between shifts  the interior is likewise mint  with the exception of a pioneer head unit and cd changer  i have replaced the power antenna but will soon need a new one my fault  not the car s  also  i have retrofitted a set of accord ex six spoke alloys  what i have ended up with  i feel  is a remarkably well built  slick looking  but not ostentatious  efficient little hauler that can scoot pretty well when you ask it to  if you can find one with a manual  they re out there  but rare  i say go for it  even in general  i cannot recommend the accord wagon enough  i d buy another one in a second  don t think i ll need to for a while  though  ,purchase accord use year ago past april fourth hand product purchase others well miles run fearlessly get sell scrap specimen push snap right away accord wagon ever see speed despite character flaw attribute previous owner bone headdress break antenna cheerily tint windows rusty rear quarter flaw common older hand easily presentable periodic inspection clear rear tender drain musician load accord hill heavy musical gear never complain even load return pg candle great speed surprisingly quick share fun dust occasional slam import focus enjoy immensely look driver face watch rear jumper bounce shift interior likewise mint exception pioneer head unit change replace power antenna soon need new one fault car also retrofit set accord ex six speak allow end feel remarkably well build sick look ostentatiously efficient little haulers scott pretty well ask find one manual rare say go even general recommend accord wagon enough buy another one second think need though
89,camera, after taking the time to  really learn my camera  i am thrilled with it  i m guessing i m not the only one that went from a nice  point and shoot  35 mm camera to a digital  i received mine as a holiday gift or perhaps i would have realized i was buying something beyond my  expertise  forget the manual  i had better luck with third party books  specifically  so you bought a digital camera  now what    sold at barnes  noble  sony really needs to support the buyer with a full fledged operating manual for both the camera and the accompanying pared down version of software that you get  that allows you to  use the photographs that said  my only other gripe would be the delay the  focus  feature causes in getting action shots  i always thought that holding down the shutter part way  froze the action  but now realize the camera is only freezing the  focus  and if you follow through and take the shot  it won t be the image you saw  frozen  in the display  but a second or two  later  you can always use the  movie  setting to record action  but you can t extract individual frames  as would  seem possible the quality of what you do get is amazing i love to be able to change the photo from it s original color to sepia or to black in white right on the camera without affecting the  original photo the  movie  mode has been a great way to preserve family snippets in sizes easily e mailed the battery life is incredible  i have always had the battery to do what i wanted  something that almost never happens with our sony video camera  the viewfinder comes in real handy when bright outside light renders the lcd screen invisible and it can be adjusted for those of you that wear glasses i use my camera just about every day and i am always happening upon  new features  new to  me anyways  i may have been pleased with a less expensive camera option  but i truly can t imagine being without digital now  ,take time really learn camera thrill guess one go nice point shoot mm camera digital receive mine holiday gift perhaps would realize buy something beyond expertise forget manual better luck third party book specifically buy digital camera sell barge noble sonya really need support buyer full pledge operate manual camera accompany par version software get allow use photograph say grip would delay focus feature cause get action shots always think hold shutter part way freeze action realize camera freeze focus follow take shoot image saw freeze display second two later always use movie set record action extract individual frame would seem possible quality get amaze love able change photo original color septa black white right camera without affect original photo movie mode great way preserve family shippers size easily fail battery life incredible always battery want something almost never happen sonya video camera viewfinder come real handy bright outside light render lead screen invisible adjust wear glass use camera every day always happen upon new feature new anyway may please less expensive camera option truly imagine without digital
90,camera, we needed a digital camera for construction site photos at work  so knowing i m a gadget and camera freak  they assigned me to be the buyer of a digital camera  i found the c 211 at a clearance sale for  135 00  here s my opinion b  what you get   intro   the olympus c 211 comes with a large set of multi lingual instruction manuals  and a quick start guide  well written  and hard to come across in this day where more and more camera makers are putting their manual on c d  disks  you of course get the c 211 camera  a neck strap and len s cap  a usb cable for photo downloading  a video cable for viewing photos on a television  a pack of polaroid 500 film  and an 8 meg smart media memory card  as you can guess  you ll want to buy a larger card  as you ll only get about 5 images on an 8 meg card at the camera s fine setting  a set of aa batteries and software c d  top off the list of in the box goods b  the good   in olympus tradition  photo quality is very good  showing lots of detail and nice  if perhaps a bit subdued  colors  with a top resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels  2 megapixel  you ll be able to print excellent 5 x 7 photos  and some pretty nice 8 x 10 photos  too  on my h p  printer using photo paper  the photos were great  but using the self serv lab printer at my local walgreens  the photos were outstanding  these self serve printers can be found at wal mart  cvs  and eckerd drug stores  too you can of course  set the camera for a lower 640 x 480 pixel size  and use these photos for email or web pages  there are two  quality  settings at this lower size  and on screen even they look very nice  with lots of details  though they will not look very good via your printer  you can however  use the c 211 s built in polaroid printer to print even these lower resolution photos with decent results  since the polaroids are only 2 x 3 inches in size  i found the polaroid prints to be decent in quality   i ve seen better from an inkjet printer of course  but they re a bit better than prints from an actual polaroid camera  in the camera s settings you can adjust the printed photos contrast and brightness  to some degree  besides the two pixel sizes of photos  you can adjust quality settings as well  either standard quality  sq  for web use  high quality  hq  for everyday photos  super high quality  shq  for prints  and tiff mode  no compression  for even more detailed larger prints  be aware that tiff prints require tons of space on a memory card  so use sparingly  and only if you really want a good 8 x 10 print the lens is a 3 x optical zoom  good  with a digital zoom option  which i avoid as digital zooms always degrade an image s quality  the lens is threaded  so you can screw on 35 5mm sized filters  a big plus to me  since many digital cameras still do not have this ability without adding awkward adapters to the lens  i recommend getting a cheap uv filter right off the bat  to protect the main lens  your lens cap will still clip on to the front of the filter  35 5mm is a somewhat awkward size  but you can find them in limited supplies at ritz camera stores  only through special order at wolf camera  however the menu and control buttons are arranged nicely on the back of the camera  next to the color lcd display  the zoom control is via a toggle type lever that surrounds the control buttons  easily reachable with your thumb  the menu button scrolls you through the camera s various settings  including setting up the camera for the 15 second  video  mode  352 pixels in size  photo quality modes  and more  a larger  print  button allows you to print the photo you re viewing on the lcd screen via the built in printer  push it  and poof  out pops a polaroid that develops fully in about 5 minutes b  the bad   the c 211 uses 4  aa sized batteries  anyone who has used digital cameras before though  knows that off the shelf alkaline batteries are eaten like candy by these things  and i found that alkalines have an extremely short life in the c 211  since there is no optical viewfinder on this camera  you must rely on the color lcd to be on at all times to compose your photos  and since the lcd is the largest battery draining part of a camera  this contributes to short battery life  15 20 shots  max  trying some rechargeable nimh batteries  my results were a bit better  maybe 50 photos using the lcd  zoom  and flash  on about one fifth of the shots  note you can use a usb memory  smart media  card reader to download your photos into the computer instead of the camera s usb cable  to conserve battery power  the lcd is as on most digital cameras  hard to see outdoors in bright sunlight  there is a flap that opens above for daylight use  that improves visibility somewhat  but just be prepared to  squint  a bit in sunlight  when composing photos  an anti glare coating on the lcd s glass would have helped  size does matter when it comes to carrying about a digital camera all day  and here  the c 211 is a whopper  roughly 9 inches tall and thick to accommodate the printer  it s big by any camera s terms  and the included neck strap is definitely needed  you will not carry this in one hand all day at the zoo  i m not sure i should list this as a  bad  thing  as again  there s simply no way they could have included a printer without the camera being this size  but if you re looking for a  carry around  digital camera  this would be a liability b  extras   the manual suggests that a 64 meg smart media card is the largest size card you can use for this camera  but i have a 128 meg card in ours  and it works fine  with the camera set at 1600 x 1200 pixels  and  shq  i can take roughly 90 photos with such a large card  cards are cheap now  so stock up so you don t run out of pixel power b  finals   in terms of digital image quality  i give the c 211 a large  thumbs up  the polaroid prints i give a  decent  grade too in quality  they have muted colors and can be a bit grainy  but again  they re better than standard polaroid camera prints usually are  in terms of size however  i have to say that i would recommend this camera more for  field use  by people in the construction field  police  fire  insurance  or real estate agents  as opposed to the casual snap shooter who wants to carry a camera to outings and gatherings  for less money  you can still find an olympus d 490  which is essentially the same camera minus the built in printer  and is much smaller if you do need a printer camera however  the c 211 is a good one to have  look for bargains  too  some stores are still trying to get  599 for this thing  and i have seen them on sale for as little as  135 00  clearance  to  249 00  occasional office max sales  so shop around  and happy snapping

94,auto, we bought this van because we needed more room for a growing family  this van seemed to have more space than the other types that were on the market  we test drove pretty much all makes and settled on this one this van handles very well in the snow  the anti lock brakes and front wheel drive are major pluses on this vehicle  it also handles well in the city and on the interstate  i think it is also easy to park i was not crazy about the warranty  a 3 year 30 000 mile warranty is not much  i also believe that you shouldn t have to buy an extended warranty on a new vehicle  this year with it being 4 years old  we have had to replace the condenser on the air conditioning  we have also had to have new brakes put on  this is a low mileage vehicle  i did not feel that it is holding up well  i think anyone with a good sized family might consider looking at one of these vans  i would check the repair history on it before purchasing br br  ,buy van need room grow family van seem space type market test drive pretty much make settle one van candle well snow anti lock rake front wheel drive major plume vehicle also candle well city interstate think also easy park crazy warranty year mile warranty much also believe buy extend warranty new vehicle year years old replace condense air condition also new rake put low mileage vehicle feel hold well think anyone good size family might consider look one van would check repair history purchase br

97,camera, i thought i had found the perfect 4 megapixel camera  perhaps not i came to the a80 as the proud owner of canon s eos rebel 35mm camera  which is a workhorse piece of photography equipment and very  very highly recommended  canon knows photography  and the brand s popularity is  in my estimation  justly deserved  the a80 promises the convenience of a point and shoot as well as much of the flexibility of an slr  with excellent performance in either case  and at an exceptional price point  the user takes as little or as much control of the photo making process as he she prefers  and the results are extremely satisfying generally  i think the promise is largely fulfilled  all of the familiar photo taking modes from fully automatic  to portrait  to sports  to night  to panoramic  to fully manual  to aperture control  etc are represented here  in addition to two user preset modes for storing your preferred settings  there is  as above  tremendous opportunity for flexibility  auto white balance  or manual  control of flash intensity  control of iso setting  a automatic multi focus  defeatable  the ability to add attachment lenses  etc and so on  all of which is well documented in other reviews  not to mention in the serviceable  if somewhat lean  instruction manual  the camera s start up time is quick and the average user will fire up the a80 and be taking very good photos in no time overall  image quality is superb  even at modest resolution settings  at the best resolution  images are stunningly precise and seem to have very natural color balance  options exist for shooting in enhanced color  black and white and sepia as well  purple fringing is a non issue for me  although i can see it  it doesn t bother me  results in indoor without a flash  a potentially tricky situation  can be very  very good with the proper mode selection and tweaking  and outdoor results in daylight are about as good as it gets  shooting performance is very good  with very acceptable shuttler lag  quick camera start up time  and decent  3x  optical zoom capability  battery consumption is quite conservative  and you will get hundreds of exposures from a single charge of 4aa rechargeables the included software works  but i like the simplicity of xp s camera manager  the movie mode works  but at a limited resolution compared with other models  including canon s little brother  the a70  which has a vga movie mode  this feature is fun  but nothing more in my estimation my problems with the camera center around ergonomics  i still haven t found a use for the flip screen other than flipping it back into the camera so that the lcd is protected  i m somewhat concerned about the long term durability of the mechanism that allows for screen rotation and flipping  and  as has been mentioned elsewhere  the lcd is simply too small  readable  yes  sufficient in resolution  probably  too small  absolutely  the placement of the slider that toggles between shooting and playback modes is ok  but the actual slider itself feels flimsy and cheap  and i also worry about its durability  the a70 seems to have a superior switch for this function  i m also not thrilled with the placement of the zoom control  and probably would have preferred it on the rear of the camera  finally  a diopter correcting knob for the viewfinder is a must in a camera like this there s a lot to like here  and it s hard to argue with the shooting performance of this camera  unfortunately  the engineering isn t quite what it ought to be  and i m considering moving to another model  a camera with this much shooting prowess ought to have a better lcd and better review controls  ,think find perfect megapixel camera perhaps come proud owner canon os rebel mm camera workhouse

98,camera,  sony mavica takes cd r technology on the road  i ve been a nikon disciple for over 10 years  but the new cd capable sony mavica lured me away from the digital coolpix series  while planning a trip to europe  i decided my venerable nikon cp 900 just wasn t up to the vacation photo task anymore  i wanted more control than the 900 could offer  precise aperture and shutter priorities  manual focusing  finer ev compensation  and external flash options the two latest nikon offerings  the cp 990 and the professional d1 both fit the bill  we d all be using the d1 if we could afford it  but after consulting the checkbook  my considerations came down to either updating my nikon or braving the waters on a first generation product with the new sony mavica cd 1000  the destination for my digital work is primarily the web  so the difference between a 2 or 3 megapixel camera is negligible  if my final product is a print  there is still no substitute for film b much better image quality than previous mavicas  in the past  i ve been a snob for the  quot nikkor glass quot  and that influenced my decision in the digital format as well  with the previous generations of mavicas  the floppy file size limitation put the image quality far below my standards  nevermind the quality of the glass  with a firm step forward  sony has broken through that barrier by exchanging the floppies for cds  increasing the capacity a hundredfold  now that the new mavica isn t crippled by disk size  the real quality of the photos can be seen without the overbearing jpg compression  while based on the same body and electronics  the cd 1000 s normal file size is three times larger than it s sister mavica fd 95  that means less lossy compression and cleaner originals  there s even the option to write totally uncompressed tiffs  and this is the one camera that has the storage capacity to do it the new cd 1000 covered most of my wishlist  giving me much more manual control than the previous 900 i was used to  i m still waiting for the day when i can match my favorite glass to a digital ccd  but until then  this new sony will fit the bill  the new mavica offers one important advantage over the nikon as a vacation camera  while traveling abroad  the cd r capable mavica has unchained me from the laptop  instead of the hourly chore of moving all the images to a hard drive to clear up room  i can now simply swap in a new disc   6 for a pack of 5  each one holds 170 full resolution images b still camera in camcorder clothing  the most unsuspecting feature i ve found is the brilliant image stabilization technology  while using the long 10x telephoto or the macro mode  this jitter reducing feature really gives you a tack sharp photo even with less than steady hands  you can now forget the tripod for quick macro shots  this still camera acts more like a modified video unit than a traditional slr  and borrows heavily from sony s camcorder expertise  it has a comfortable slr feel with an ergonomic grip  in one way i admire the larger  more traditional pro sumer look  but i also miss the stealth possible from the small rotating coolpix body  add on the external flash  bracket  and a lumiquest  and this mavica will let you mix slyly in with any pro photographers  my standard film gear includes nikon f3s and old heavy lenses  so the bulkiness and weight isn t a detraction to me  but be warned that this is one of the largest digicams you re likely to lift the lens paired with the cd 1000 is a 10x monster that gives you the 35mm equivalent of 39 390mm  for my shooting style  i d much rather have something on the wider end and less telephoto  necessary accessories include the wide angle adapter  50  and external flash unit  100  luckily  this camera frees you from the coolpix necessary accessories of batteries  charger  and a card reader  the mavica includes sony s smart lithium ion battery technology which recharges inside of the camera and also communicates with the body to let you know exactly how many minutes of life it has left  the battery recharges in 3 to 4 hours  lasts over two hours with lcd  and extras are  50 each  another unique feature of the sony is dual lcd screens  a decent one on the back and another inside the viewfinder  turning off the larger one saves battery power  and having the smaller one allows you to shoot just like an slr b great piece but too expensive  of course there are downsides with any first generation product  the durability of a portable cd writing mechanism is often questioned  but this mavica has performed flawlessly so far  even while trying to make the laser skip when writing  this delay while the cd records brings up the biggest frustration with the new mavica  the wait from pressing the shutter to the next available frame is still far too long  i understand this is a limit of the technology  but why not use a simple ram buffer to allow a series of 5 photos before having to write to the disc  the delay actually isn t as bad as i expected  often between 3 and 4 seconds  about the same as my old nikon which was simply writing to a smartmedia card  despite the long reaching telephoto and image stabilization  this camera is not capable of high level sports photography  anything above little league  and the action will be too fast for the camera to handle   of course  this can be said about any digital camera currently under  5000  the manual focusing ring is too small and not precise enough for quick follow focusing skills  while a digicam with manual focus might interest those wanting more control  trying to focus the small grainy lcd is nothing like using a bright slr viewfinder the mavica cd 1000 isn t the perfect digicam  but it may be the best yet in combining quality imaging with ease of use while still allowing enough manual adjustment for the pro in all of us  it is currently overpriced  you pay a  300 premium for the cd capability over the sister mavica  but should be in the  1000 range soon enough  sony put together a great package of features and finally produced a model that will get the attention of serious amateur photographers

99,auto, first of i must say i am a gm person  it 146s not that often that i find myself straying from the gm pack  but because of certain reason i now find myself looking for an new car and as a joke i went to the local hyundai dealership to test drive a new tiburon with the 2 7l v6  by the end of the test drive i found that what i thought would be a poorly built joke to be a very nice affordable sports coupe that gives competition a huge run for the money b first impressions i exterior b i there were 2 models i was looking at one was silver the other was black  both had very unique styling  this gave it a very sporty and appealing look  i noticed the large sport spoiler which made the car look even better  the tail lights gave the car a sporty look but also offered other motorist visibility  it also had dual exhaust which sounded amazing when the sales person fired up the car  i couldn 146t resist and had to take it for a spin b i interior b i when getting in the car i had mixed feelings  the first thing i noticed was leather seats  and what got me was not only did it have leather seats but they are standard in the v6 model  what cars do you know that offer standard leather seats for under 20k  the dash and gauges seemed a little plain which is where i get the mixed feelings from  but really when looking at the overall design of the car it fits in quite nice  and with the dealership installed dash kit you can add some color and make them look fantastic  the sets were a little stiff and i m not sure how well the leather seats would hold up long term  the gauges are easy to read it did take me awhile to get everything adjusted  but i wouldn 146t really consider that as to being a design problem b the test drive b i have had an automatic for the last 2 years so i was expecting to kill the car a few times due to some hills and snow  however not once in the test drive did i kill the car or did it hesitate  the 6 speed manual was extremely simple to operate  the only thing that we couldn 146t figure out was how to put the car in reverse  it took about 10 min to figure it out  you have to pull up on the handle and then put it in reverse  i headed straight for the highway after leaving the dealership to see what the v6 6 speed combo was made of  there was a base mustang next to me in the other lane  and he was showing off trying to be cool  so i decided to test shifting  i downshifted and took of down the street  the look on the guys face was worth the test drive alone  the gears are easy to find and the clutch is excellent  indianapolis is going through a lot or road construction so there were a lot of bumps and bad roads  the car did well over them but at times it seemed the car was so stiff that it just kind of jumps over them  that created a somewhat harsh ride quality b specifications b the hyundai coupe is offered in either 2 0l 4 cylinder  producing 133hp 4800 rpm  or 2 7l v6  producing 177 4000 rpm  both have a standard 5 speed manual with an optional 4 speed shiftronic automatic  the v6 model has an available 6 speed manual available with a package group  front suspension on both is an independent mcpherson struts w coil springs and a rear independents multi link with coil springs  sport tuned n the v6 models  4 wheel disc brakes are standard all around abs is optional  16  silver painted alloy wheels are standard on

want to call it  starts at 16 7k  with destination charge  with the standard package  the only thing that 146s optional is the rear spoiler  leather seats  sunroof  and abs  the auto starts at 17 6k b

100,auto, back in january i started looking for a new car to replace my acura integra  it ultimately came down to the bmw 328ci and audi a4 2 8  i liked the more aggressive styling of the bmw 3 series but i couldn t justify the  38 000 price tag for the 328ci  about  5k more for essentially 20 more horsepower vs  the 323ci  so in the ultimate feat of rationalization i opted for the audi s4 which was  2k more than the 328ci  with the added benefit of 60 more horsepower  full time 4 wheel drive  and an extra 2 doors   i ended up ordering a 2001 model at the end of march and it arrived at the dealer at the end of june  the major differences between the 2000 and 2001 models are  1   1k higher sticker price  2  addition of esp  electronic stability program  3  sport package became an added cost option  and 4  longer warranty  4yr 50k mi  be prepared for a wait if you plan on purchasing the s4 since it s a limited production car  especially in california i ve had my 2001 s4 for about 1700 miles now  and i ve loved every single mile of it  it s metallic silver with the onyx  black  interior  with the premium package  aka convenience package on the 2000 model  and bose audio system  i opted to not get the 6 disc changer option since the oem unit  panasonic  can be had for  279 aftermarket vs   650 installed with the car b engine performance  this car is a pleasure to drive  it s got incredible torque at low rpm s  258 lb ft   1850 3600 rpm  so acceleration is effortless  and downright wicked if you floor it  it took a while for me to get used to the car s power as i was unintentionally launching like a rocket at green lights since i was used to the engine of my former  torque weak  acura integra  also  the car is very composed at highway speeds  so much so that i often don t realize that i was going 80  mph when i thought i was going 60 since the cabin is very quiet and composed the six speed took a little getting used to since the reverse gear is next to 1 2  you push down  then left past 1 2  then up whereas on my integra it was down from 5th gear  the throws are much longer as well  feels like you ll be elbowing people in the back seat  which is the only real driveability drawback that i see in this otherwise amazing car  an aftermarket short shifter is definitely on the upgrade list the car is after all a 4 door sedan  so it s not nearly as tossable as my old integra  there is more lean that i would like when i toss the car from side to side  but it s pretty taut for a stock suspension  regardless  i feel it s got a good balance between performance and comfort  i ve autocrossed the car once  and it definitely needs a stiffer and lower suspension for these type of events  but for everyday driving it s a good compromise oh yeah  there is quite a lively aftermarket for the s4 there are at least 4 aftermarket tuners that you can go to for a new ecu which will easily bump your horsepower in the 310 hp range  stock is 250hp  and torque into the 360 ft lbs range  stock is 258 ft lbs  for about  500 600  so if you ever tire of the stock 250hp engine  you ve got options  b interior  the front seats are comfortable and i never felt fatigued from the seats during extended driving  i wish the side bolsters were a little more beefy or adjustable  though  the rear seats are quite cramped  and i wished audi would have made the cavernous trunk a little smaller so that passengers would have a little more legroom  they d almost be more comfortable laying down in the trunk  if you ve ever seen the truck of the s4 a4 you ll know what i mean    if the trunk wasn t big enough for you  you can also fold down the 60 40 rear seats and fit your groceries for the next 6 months in there  audi placed 2 cup holders under the center arm rest hello  you need to keep the arm rest up if you want to use either of these cup holders  but luckily there is a neat little retractable cup holder in the center console that you have more direct access to driving with the sunroof open at highway speeds creates a loud droning sound between 35 45 mph  this is very annoying  but my solution is to drive faster   it s unexcusable  though  to have this happen on a  40k  car  never had this problem in my integra  there is also wind noise from the side mirrors at highway speeds  a slight whistling sound  too to use the cruise control you have to fiddle with a stalk on the steering column  to accelerate after you activated cruise control  you press the button on the end of the stalk  but to slow down you have to use a different slider switch  which also serves to turn the cruise on off  clumsy to say the least  i wish they placed the controls on the steering wheel like my old integra b exterior  the avus rims are a huge brake dust magnet  i ve been told that applying car wax to the rims will help with cleaning  any which way  i think i ll be cleaning off brake dust quite often  i didn t like the styling of the rims initially  but it has grown on me and now i like them b audio  the bose system sounds pretty decent for a stock radio  albeit a little too heavy on the bass  i listen to a lot of bass heavy music  trance  house  hip hop  etc  so the system s bass heavy emphasis works nicely for me  but it gets a little irratating after prolonged listening sometimes  i haven t really cranked it up  but i have heard from others that the bass gets muddy at higher volumes as well b maintenance  every 2001 audi comes with a 4yr 50 000 mile warranty  2001 models received a longer warranty than previous years  during which time all scheduled maintenance is included with the car purchase even down to replacing windshield wipers b summary  wow  go get one  you won t be disappointed  you ll notice that the negatives that i

102,camera, for anyone looking to venture into the world of digital cameras  you cannot go wrong with the pentax optio 33l  this camera is packed with so many features that even camera enthusiasts will enjoy this camera  what is truly surprising is that the optio 33l can be purchased at an amazingly low price of around  200  most other 3 megapixel cameras with these type of features still sell for  300 to  400  let s take a closer look b features  while many people  myself included  tend to only use basic features and ignore the more complex features  i found myself experimenting and playing with all the features that come loaded onto the pentax optio 33l  why is this  i think the main reason is because the menus were so easy to navigate that it was almost fun a few of my favorite features are as follows  first of all  i love the digital filters that come preset with the camera  these filters include sepia  b w  b w red  b w blue  our personal favorite  b w green  blue  red  and green  my wife always pays those over priced photo studios major bucks to add filtering to their pictures  once my wife saw how great this camera took pictures using the digital filters  she vowed to never pay extra at those studios ever again a second feature i love is the preset camera settings that come built in  you can choose from portrait  flower  landscape  3 d  panarama  night scene  or you can manually program your own settings using the sharpness  contrast and saturation settings  the optio 33l is one of the few cameras in this price range that gives you these manual controls  we tend to use the portrait mode most  but i have had fun playing around with the panarama mode another lesser known feature  but one of the main reasons we bought the camera  is the p i m ii capability  p i m stands for print image matching and what this means is that your printed photos will be enhanced using a p i m printer  nice marketing technique since epson is the one selling these printers  we bought the epson stylus photo 825 and received a  75 rebate just because we bought a camera that was p i m enabled  you can t beat getting a nice photo printer for  25  so how do the p i m enhanced pictures come out  excellent  the images are crisp  clear and vibrant and are identical to what you see when you take the picture  we couldn t be happier let me quickly run down some of the other nice features  the camera has a 3x optical and 2 7x digital zoom for an impressive 8x combined zoom  i like the position of the zoom button and it is easy to use  closeups come out sharp and clear  it has a nice swivel lcd screen that allows you to take self portrait or groups shot  this is extremely handy when taking a group photo as everyone can see the countdown timer and knows when the picture will be taken  you can create a 30 second movie  fun to play with but not very good quality  or see a slide show of your photos  we usually use the included video cable to hook it up to the tv to watch the slide show  our kids get a kick out of it  you can also protect your favorite photos and save your favorite camera settings  i also like the fact that you only need two aa batteries to power the camera as opposed to the four aa batteries that most other cameras require  just make sure you use nimh rechargeables  which are a wise investment with any digital camera purchase  all in all this is one feature packed camera b drawbacks  i ve heard many reviewers of this camera complain about the lack of a viewfinder  i ll admit that it would be nice to have a viewfinder  but as i use the camera more and more it becomes less of an issue for me  once in a great while i have a hard time seeing the lcd screen in extremely bright sunlight  but once i attached the include lcd sunblocker  just a flimsy piece of black cardboard  i could see the lcd screen just fine another drawback is the shutter lag  but i have to say that most cameras in this price range have some sort of shutter lag  what is neat about this camera is that you can halfway depress the picture taking button to warm up the camera  once you see the red light you can press the button the rest of the way and the photo will be taken instantaneously  it takes some practice  but i ve gotten pretty good at it finally  the camera tends to white out the images in dark settings  this is easily solved  however  if you learn to use the proper settings b final comments  this is a great 3 34 megapixel camera that gives you plenty of bang for your buck  sure  there are nicer 3 megapixel cameras out there but you will pay considerably more for them  ,anyone look venture world digital camera go wrong mental option camera pack many feature even camera enthusiast enjoy camera truly surprise option purchase amazingly low

103,camera, after years of using my yashica f109 35mm slr  with a manual focus  for occasions such as parties  weddings  etc  i was ready for an upgrade  i initially intended to buy a fully automatic 35mm film camera  as prices are very competitive these days  my hesitation with a digital camera purchase was my belief that the pictures would not be comparable in quality with that of a good film camera  however  after looking at photos taken by a friend with a fuji 3mp camera  i was convinced that i could be happy with a digital camera and jumped on the  net to do some research   actually  epinions com was one of the first places i visited  and yes  the three reviews above did help me make my decision  after realizing the obvious benefits of owning a digital camera  i made a short list of the cameras i could afford  since i only wanted to spend about 300 00  and headed to circuit city  i chose the d550 because of it s price  size  and features  the camera comes with the  standard  16 mb card  but hey  all of the cameras i looked at had the same thing   i purchased a 64mb card for another  35 00  after bringing the camera home and opening the package  i discovered the first of only three issues i have with this camera to date   the manual provided inside the box is very small  and does not include all the info you want or need  yes  there is a more detailed manual on the cd  but who wants to boot up a computer just to read about spot metering  anyhow  i read the manual and immediately began taking pictures  the menus on the lcd screen are not complicated  and easy to navigate  you can also post thumbnail type pics on the screen  9 at a time  to view what you have so far on disk  for a person with their first digital camera  that was a pleasant suprise  i was really impressed with the picture quality  after using the  zoom in  feature to take a closer look at the picture as it was displayed on the lcd  i took several pics in different settings   low light  daytime outdoors  and interior with artificial light  the real test  however  was how the pics would look after being printed out  i hooked it up to my computer which runs on win 98  and it took with no problems  the cd included has a detailed manual  along with the camedia 4 0 software  after installing the camera s driver  however  i discovered the second issue   there is no ac adaptor included with the camera  so you have to use the battery power to transfer your pictures to the computer  and it doesn t seem that the batteries last long when you re doing so much with the camera taking pics  previewing them  and then transfering to the pc  yes  the camera must be  on  for you to transfer the pics  what i ended up doing was buying a  15 00 pny smartmedia card reader writer   usb  and installed that instead  now  i just take the card out of the camera  and isert it into the reader  i save my camera s batteries  and the reader writer requires no power supply  the pics transfer at a good rate  and my problem is solved  i then tested the software  which i must say i m happy with  now i m no professional photographer  and you probably aren t either  so i d say that most people are like me and would be more than happy with the software  it allows you to preview the pics  crop  resize  rotate  add text or clean up the pics  and lets you not only print out the pics in different packages  but has templates for greeting cards  post cards  calenders  etc  yeah  the templates aren t endless  but what do you want for  300 00  photoshop 7 from adobe  the software is more than adequate  i printed out several pics using my cannon s600  which only prints at 1200 x 1200  and i must say i m very impressed  i printed out one 5 x 7  a calender with a good size pic on it  and 9 wallet size pics on a single sheet  all of the pictures came out great  and i have absolutely no complaints about their quality  the drag and drop ease of the software makes it a breeze to use  so  although i have to insert the cd to read the more detailed instructions  i m happy with my purchase choice  you won t go wrong with this camera  i can t speak about shutter speeds yet  because i haven t tested this camera a ability to shoot moving targets  personally  that s not what i bought the camera for  so far  though  this camera has not failed to impress me  it s exactly what i needed  and i am now officially part of the digital camera enthusiasts  club  my next obsession will probably be a 12 megapixel digital slr   wow  what will that be like  ,years use yashica mm sir manual focus

105,camera, i ve been a professional photographer for more than 20 years i ve been interested in digital cameras for about 9 years when i first purchased an apple quicktake cute camera though the photos looked best on screen it was a start on my digital life though about 8 digicams later i moved up to the nikon d100 i got one of the early batches with one phone call even though i was on a ritz list for ages they didn t come thru as quick as just picking up the phone on a whim so i ve had this camera for at least 5 months now and use it in my work as a photographer i shoot alot of editorial and pr work so my lighting and situations are always different early on i realized my nikon sb 28 flash would not give good results with this camera and i purchased the sb 80dx soon after i realized my 3rd party lenses would be giving me error messages and would stop functioning when the d100 would not recognize that a lens was attached so i bought all new nikon lenses big ones little ones short ones expensive ones i am not alone when i say that every photo taken inside outside and with or without flash is underexposed and not very sharp i ve sat in the same position using every single setting that this camera has and it s not been remedied i ve also used ever nikon af lens i own from the 16mm fisheye to the 80 200 2 8 d photoshop will fix everything up i use ps 7 on a mac but when i do a big job and come back with 1500 images the last thing i want is a numb arm and blood shot eyes from being in front of the computer for 2 days making adjustments i have spoken with many other pros that have this problem as well nikon denies a problem exists but will go on to say that it s careful not to blow out the highlights and whites because if that happens you have a completely unusable image i shoot in jpeg format since i have to shoot alot and shoot fast so i don t really need the nikon 3 capture software that cost appx  150 00 but since i have to do color correction and saturation adjustments on most images i have not found a batch solution that is workable and repeatable i have shot a few raw images and they looked good i did not purchase the nikon capture 3 software so after 30 days it expired the best digicam software is from the kodak high end cameras it amazes me that nikon would charge for their software which isn t very good anyway i m not sorry i bought the d100 as the pros are that the battery life is excellent and it fits well in my hand and the weight is good i borrowed a d1x and it was too heavy for all day jobs for me my next digicam will most likely be the kodak 14n or whatever  the big files appeal to me for big prints and my stock photography needs big files as well i know kodaks pro cameras have always been the best around and ditto for their software unless of course nikon improves on the d100  ,professional photographer years interest digital camera years first purchase apple quicktake cut camera though photo look best screen start digital life though digicams later move union get one early patch one phone call even though rite list age come thou quick pick phone whim camera least months use work photographer shoot clot editorial work light situations always different early realize union flash would give good result camera purchase soon realize rd party lenses would give error message would stop sanction would recognize lens attach buy new union lenses big ones little ones short ones expensive ones alone say every photo take inside outside without flash underexpose sharp sit position use every single set camera remedied also use ever union lens mm fish photoshop fix everything use mac big job come back image last thing want numb arm blood shoot eye front computer days make adjustments speak many pro problem well union deny problem exist go say careful blow highlight white happen completely unable image shoot peg format since shoot clot shoot fast really need union capture software cost apex since color correction situation adjustments image find batch solution portable respectable shoot raw image look good purchase union capture software days expire best digital software today high end camera amaze union would charge software good anyway sorry buy pro battery life excellent fit well hand weight good borrow heavy day job next digital likely today whatever big file appeal big print stock photography need big file well know oaks pro camera always best around software unless course union improve
106,camera, even i am sometimes guilty of the spontaneous purchase   the thrill of saying  quot yeah i ll take it quot  with absolutely no clue whether what you re buying is a quality item or is even worth the price of the fluff sitting at the bottom of your pocket buying the dsc s30 was one of those moments  and while it was an exciting purchase  my wife and i have wanted a digital camera for ages  there was that little voice softly saying  quot but what if it s a lemon quot  thankfully  we ignored that little voice  because this time throwing caution to the wind paid off big time  not only had we made a good choice  but in fact we d made  the  good choice the camera was bought at sears  they had the price set at the full retail of  499  with a price match to the local best buy of  399 and the sony rebate of  100  for also buying a vaio  that s another tale  the final price was  299 plus tax  just beautiful  what s even more satisfying is that it s easily worth  499 when considering what other similar cameras are going for now so on to the camera setting it up was a breeze  really just a few short steps  attach the lens cover  attach the carrying strap  plug in the battery  or hook up to wall power  insert the memory stick  and you re off  or so i thought  interesting anecdote here  and remember that i was new to digital cameras  i got it all set up  thanks to the manual  which is straightforward  and tried to take a picture  i pressed the shutter button  heard a beep  saw something on the lcd  but no picture  what  i tried a million different things  from formatting the memory stick to using different resolutions to adjusting the flash  the focus  you name it  i learned a lot about the camera during that mad frenzy to take a picture  that s for sure  i was just about ready to give up and call it broken when i noticed something in the manual about  quot press the shutter button halfway quot  oh  duh with that out of the way  i took about 20 pictures of everything i could find in the house  my wife  the cat  a pumpkin  myself  nothing was safe  it was so much fun let s go over the pros of the camera b display b  the lcd display is very bright and crisp  and aiming the camera using it seems natural  you can even make it brighter with a slider on the side of the camera  navigating the camera s many features using the on screen interface is painless and intuitive  sony s menu system is arranged very nicely and the one button controller works surprisingly well  i was able to try out most of the features for the first time without referring to the manual b battery b  sony s infolithium battery charges fully in a bit less than two hours  and according to the manual lasts that long while in use  my own experiences seem to agree with this  a very nice feature is that the camera reports the approximate number of minutes of charge remaining on the battery  very handy b memory stick b  sony s proprietary memory system  these little sticks hold memory up to 128mb and i hear that 256 and 512mb versions are on the way  that s a lot of pictures  understatement  we picked up a 16mb stick with the camera for about  30  since it only comes with 4mb  the only problem i can see with these sticks is that they re so small   it d be very easy to lose track of one  transfers from the memory stick  inside the camera  to the pc are a snap  the camera comes with a usb cable   just connect the cable between the camera and the pc  the first time you do this  it will install some drivers  included on a cd with the camera  and away you go  the memory stick from that point on is recognized by windows as a removeable drive  and the files are stored there as jpg or tiff  so you can simply copy them from there to your hard drive  or view them right from the memory stick  couldn t hardly be easier b lens picture quality  the lens is a 3x optical zoom lens  with up to 6x digital zoom  another great feature of the camera is that the level of zoom is displayed on a bar on the lcd when it s being adjusted  even better is that it indicates when you re leaving optical zoom and entering digital zoom mode  it also has a macro mode  good for focus at down to 3cm  practically a microscope at that level   you can easily make a dime fill the entire display and still be in focus  the picture quality is just outstanding as well  colors are vibrant and seem true  for a camera in this price range  i was impressed b extras  the camera is loaded with features  but a couple stand out to me  first off  you can hook up the output of the lcd display to a tv or anything with a composite video input  using a supplied cable  this means you can hook it up to a vcr and actually use it as a movie camera  wow  of course you re limited by the length of the cable  but still  also  the slide show mode is awesome  in this mode  as you d expect  it cycles through all the photos currently on the memory stick  now combine these two features  and you have a stroke of sony genius  run a slide show of your photos on your tv  the quality of output to the tv is really really good   i was amazed by how good it looked  one final feature i m glad they included was the ability to store images in uncompressed tiff format  even though it s a memory hog  it s really worth it  you tend to forget that jpg does degrade image quality since it looks so good  but comparing the two you definitely notice artifacts in the jpg output  take a few photos using the camera s highest resolution in tiff format if you want to impress your friends the cons  yes there are a couple b no optical viewfinder b  most of the time this isn t an issue  because the digital viewfinder is so bright  but in extremely bright conditions  an optical viewfinder would have been nice b lens button design b  i m not terribly fond of the placement for the buttons which operate the user interface  the problem is that i tend to use the thumb of my left hand to use these buttons  and in this position it s natural for the forefingers of this hand to grasp the camera by the lens  often i have to remember not to do that  a minor gripe to be sure  but a gripe nonetheless conclusion this camera practically has it all and then some  with a few bonus features i wasn t expecting  in its price class it can t be beat  and i am extremely pleased with my  quot accidental quot  purchase  very highly recommended br br  ,even sometimes guilty spontaneous purchase thrill say quit yeah take quit absolutely clue whether buy quality item even worth price fluff sit bottom pocket

107,auto, the toyota solara convertible is a huge mistake by toyota  it is a butchered stock solara instead of a convertible built from the ground up the solara is a good car in many respects  pre convertible conversion  the acceleration is outstanding on the v6 and it is loaded with lots of amenities if you are willing to pay enough  this includes power everything  leather upholstery  etc as for the convertible  the chopped off top results in a lack of stability in the structure and you gets a noisy uncomfortable ride  the top itself is poorly designed and does not seem to be 100  air tight  occasionally droplets of water will sneak in  and you will have lots of road noise  the car rides quieter with the top down another annoying feature is that you cannot bring the top back up unless you are in park  the chrysler sebring allows you to do it if you are going slow enough so if you are caught in 5mph traffic with exhaust in your face  you cannot bring the top up toyota needs to redesign this from scratch to get it right  ,tooth solar convertible huge mistake tooth butcher stock solar instead convertible build grind solar good car many respect pre convertible conversion acceleration outstanding load lot amenities will pay enough include power everything leather upholstery etc convertible chop top result lack stability structure get noisy uncomfortable ride top poorly design seem air tight occasionally droplets water speak lot road noise car rid quieter top another annoy feature bring top back unless park chrysler see allow go slow enough catch may traffic exhaust face bring top tooth need design scratch get right
108,camera, before i go any further  i ll let you know right now that i really like this camera  but as with any product  there are a few things i would change  also  the customer service at kodak is horrible i think the camera takes really good quality pictures  the colors are very bright  and the images are sharp  it has three different image quality settings  and also allows you to choose between megapixel resolution and 640 x 480 resolution  the second option is especially good because sometimes you don t want huge screen filling pictures that the megapixel setting records  so you can take the picture at the lower resolution  this option is especially good when designing websites with the quality set to the highest  and the resolution in megapixel mode  the camera takes about 25 pictures with the 8 mb compact flash card that is included  but another payoff of the 640 x 480 setting is that when set at this resolution at highest quality mode  the camera can literally take about 60 pictures on the 8 mb card  i think that s awesome  i ended up buying another 8 mb card  and with just the two cards i had more than enough space to take pictures on my first trip to new york city earlier this month the user interface is another really good feature of the camera  the on screen menu options are really easy to understand and are in a really user friendly font type  ok  here are some pet peeves about the camera  it eats batteries like no other  i ve found that the rate that the camera uses batteries  4 aa s  is amazing  i bought some rechargeable batteries and a recharger and that solved my problem  the camera is pretty hefty  it s a lot heavier than my last camera  and has kind of a bulky shape  it won t fit easily into your pocket    the rubber covers covering the ac adapter connection  the transfer cable connection  and the output connection at the side of the camera are kind of cheap feeling and flimsy  the time it takes to transfer pictures is really slow  a lot slower than my first camera the absolute worst problem with the camera  something kodak really needs to work on is it s phone based support  it is horrible  i really cannot stress how negative my experience in this area has been  my ac adapter broke  and i called to send it in to be repaired under warranty  the minimum waiting time any time i called was 15 minutes  i sent the camera to kodak  but instead of coming back in 7 10 days like they said  it arrived 3 weeks later  but to make things worse  the first time i used the adapter  i found that they had not fixed the problem  i had to call back repeatedly  one time being put on hold for over an hour  the reps are nice  but the waiting time is horrible and i m really mad that i have to go through the hassle again since they didn t fix it the first time ok  that s pretty much the end of my commentary on the camera  overall  i d say it s really good camera  a 4for sure  but get s downgraded to a 3 because of my horrible experience on hold for hours upon hours with kodak  if you d like to read on  it s just the story of how i got the camera and it compared to my last one  the dc 210 plus zoom is my second digital camera  my first was a pretec brand camera that my mom bought me off of aol before i went to college  it was a 640 x 480 pixel camera that had no zoom  that was a good first camera  but after a while i really wanted a zoom lens and better quality pictures   that first camera cost about  225 i think i began looking around for a camera that had a zoom lens  megapixel ability  and good quality pictures  i literally spent hours browsing different websites trying to decide which to buy  i visited about every different site that had reviews of cameras and comparison tests of digital cameras  for the money  it seemed that the kodak was the best bet i didn t buy the camera out of any retail store  but instead i bought it on ebay from a camera shop in washington for  266  including shipping  this was a great price  i bought it and ended up giving my old one to my brother  my first camera was a great one  but the pictures on the kodak are a lot better br br  ,go let know right really like camera product things would change also customer service today horrible think camera take really good quality picture color bright image sharp three different image quality settings also allow choose megapixel resolution resolution second option especially good sometimes want huge screen fill picture megapixel set record take picture lower resolution option especially good design webster quality

109,camera, the hp 612 is a good family camera  it works as a point and shot for all the family tech idiots  which includes most of the population  but will do enough fancy stuff to keep the shutter savvy busy for a while  if you want to focus other than center  you can with this one  you can zoom  flash settings are adjustable  including a shut off for those moments ruined by a photo flash bombs busting in air  but  you don t have to worry about anything if you are a  look in the hole   or lcd screen  kind of person  there are 3 basic kinds of digital cameras you can buy  the old ones with the 3 5 disc storage are being phased out  though it seems a nice idea to have the photos on the 3 5  you can t store much  you have a bulky camera and disks all over the place  the newest cd  mini  size are really high dollar  but they may very well be the ones that come out on top  that leaves the mid range cameras like the hp 612 that use memory cards which are similar to the 3 5 disks but are smaller and hold a lot more  when i looked over the compact flash style cameras  i decided to go with the hp 612  there were several reasons i went with this one after reading online and trying out digital cameras at work and with family cameras  i just have no shame at all and will say   let me check that out  so  here is how i decided        you don t have to be a rocket scientist to use this camera b  since i have two little boys and one who especially loves to take pictures  i wanted a camera that was really easy to use  eli could not take photos with the canon digital from work  it was just too complex  even the college students had a heck of time getting anything worth printing  this one involves looking in the viewfinder hole and then pushing the button  it works just like his canon owl 35 mm point and shoot which is a wonderful starter camera for little guys  the box button on the back of the hp above the lcd viewer means that the shot shows in the lcd to check out shots  just push the button  and that is just one click in addition to pushing the top button to take the picture  eli uses both those options easy as pie point and shoot and then almost easy as pie with the lcd  it took him about 5 minutes to nail the basics on this camera  and he is 9 years old   it s pocket size b  no one wants to be the holder of the stuff  at the best you can do if you have kids  you have all kinds of things that you have to haul around  i never thought i would carry the monster purse  since i usually jammed my important stuff in my levi s pocket  now  i do carry the purse   and this camera can be tucked right in for the ride  it is the size of the regular 35mm quick pic cameras  the hp doesn t come with any sort of case  so i would suggest that you protect it with something  you can buy the case  or you can use any kind of sturdy little bag  i have a little drawstring denim bag that works just fine  it keeps the camera clean and protects it  the carry handle is not the greatest and won t go around you neck  but it s ok  i keep the camera in my purse or around my wrist   you can buy your batteries at the quick trip on the corner b  ok  i know that aa batteries are not the best way to go  but i like a camera that will work with the garden variety batteries  perhaps this bias comes from living overseas where i had to point and grunt  i hated to need things that i could not describe even in english  i still do not know how to say sage in greek  and i did not have sage in the dressing balls i made that thanksgiving  dressing balls are not very good without sage  give me batteries i can recognize at a glance  anyway  this camera will work with any aa batteries you stick in the bottom  it holds four of those  they do not last very long  we run through a set of four almost every time we take pictures  our style is to carry the camera around for a couple of hours and shoot things at a birthday party or at a cook out  we run about 2 rolls per set of batteries in the 35 mm world or about 48 digital pics  if i am the keeper of the camera and i m more careful about the juice  then i can get around double  the average adult could get 100 photos on a set of batteries  right now  i am saving up to get the charger that plugs in the wall socket for rechargeable batteries  we have that at work  and it is a good idea  you charge and use the batteries over and over  that will be pretty expensive  but it does pay off in the long run  if you can afford the charger and recharge batteries  i would suggest that you get 2 sets of batteries and rotate those in the camera  you can always fall back on the regular aa when you have to b if you re thinking about getting this camera  then you do need to buy some other things        oh sigh wish it all came together b  the real must have would be the media card  actually  it works out really nice to have two of those  they are like the 3 5 disks  but they are smaller  just take the camera to the store and say you need a media card  or  you can look in the booklet and find out what you need and buy online  check out fat wallet  www fatwallet com  and click at the top to forums and watch the message strings  you ll see good deals come up  i got a smart media card for half the local price by doing that  but i got the first one at the local store to make sure i got the right thing  the reason you want the media cards is that the camera has only 8 bites of memory  that means about 24 pics stored depending on the quality you set that for  the default is the mid range  if you can take the time to check and then discard all unwanted pics on the spot to make room for more or if you stay at home all the time and can upload the photos  then you may be ok  i wouldn t bank on that though  if you get some pics on the camera and not on the disk  then you can read the booklet that comes with the camera and upload right from the camera to the disk  that is much easier i think  i try not to put any pics on the 8 mb on the camera  but sometimes i forget the memory card and then have pics there on the camera which don t show when you stick in the memory card  media cards come in lots of sizes as far as what they hold  they all look the same on the outside other than the numbers printed  i go with 64 for that and have 2 of them  they hold about 125 photos  which is enough around here  i keep one in the camera and one in the printer most times and switch out when one gets full  that reminds me to look and see what i want to get rid of or print  you don t have to buy a printer  you can use the one you have if it is color  do buy photo paper though  so the pictures will look like pictures  it s nicer to have a printer made for photos though  i got the hp 1115  the nice thing here is that i can put the memory card right in the printer and then make 4 6 photos on the spot by the numbers of the shots  it does not show the picture on the printer  though it seems like a nice idea to have all those memories stored on disk  it is just not the same to have computer pictures  they are not as much fun to look at as hard copies  one way around the printer problem is that you can take the pics and then upload to snapfish  www snapfish com  once you have the pics up and can look at them  you can edit at sf and then can order the prints you want  that s a little extra work  but that can work out if you don t want to spring for the printer b the hp 612 is not better than homemade biscuits b  though i love this camera  there are some things that i don t like  they are not major things  but they are part of the package  the big thing for me is that digital has lag time  in other words  you push the button and then it drags for a split second  that means that it is hard to get action shots  kids are active  so i miss a lot i would want to capture and could capture with a 35 mm  i usually carry both a pocket 35 mm and this camera and get all i want with the two cameras  one nice thing about digital is that you have the lcd screen and can really look at the shot before you snap  but  the lcd is really hard to see when the sun is out  i find it better to use the regular viewfinder outside  when you use the lcd  you get a black flash up and know you took a picture  when you use the viewfinder  you press and don t hear a sound  you will wonder if you actually took the picture  i often shoot 2 or 3 thinking that i did not really make a picture  i don t catch this until i review on the lcd  which works great to see what you shot or put it up on the computer and look  on the plus side  i often get better pics when i have 2 or 3 shots  yes  this one does eat batteries  and so do all the digital cameras  i m used to 35 mm which will go on and on with the same batteries  it took me a while to learn to always carry extras  this is just part of the digital camera world right now  i hope that gets better  that covers the basics      b but  how about the options b  this camera does let you play around some  it does not have as many options as some  but it has as much as i would want  unless i could afford the professional level digital which i can t  you can push the button on the back and get the menu and make the selections and also on editing some with the photos on the spot  like you can dump a bad one  the book covers it well that you get with the camera  and i can use these options when i want to  off center focus is the one thing i use the most  i hate really flat photos  and this lets me make some changes with good results  box in on what you want to highlight  push the button to take pictures half way down  then all the way down  easy enough  the zoom 2x can be nice  be aware that zoom does not have the same quality that standard would have  it s better to walk in than to zoom in  the various flash options are good  it has fill flash and also off flash  the main one i use is the off when i don t want to light up a room  the software for photos is ok  the big thing is that you do not get a booklet to cover how to use that  i use software at work and can guess on most of that  they do have some directions that you can pull up on the computer  but it is still nice to have directions to hold in your hand and look at  one of my students who never used much software called the company and raised cain about that and got a free book to help her  i think i will borrow that  so i don t have to guess so much b do you want to spring for this camera b  if you want an easy digital camera that takes good pictures  then i would say this one is solid  you ll really want to add on with the other items that do run the price up but make life easier  to get the media card and the printer  i think it about double the price overall  so figure on  500 to do this  the batteries and charger will jack it up a bit more but save you money down the road  i m not going top rate on this one  because i don t think digital cameras have maxed out yet as far as being wonderful at home  i still fall back on my 35mm  but this hp is great for what it is and what it does  if i had to pick again  i would go with this one  ,good family camera work point shoot

110,camera, having looked around the web for a digital camera i was looking at either the z1 or the canon eod300 rebel  unfortunately the rebel was out of my price range so i bought the z1  overall i made a very good choice the camera takes good pictures in the majority of circumstances  you can have full control over the aperture  exposure and focus should you wish too  the camera can take over some or all of the functions too if you wish low light shooting is easy and there is an option for sunset preserve to keep the warmth of a picture rather than overexpose to simulate full light  fast moving objects need good light  as you would expect  but the camera can still operate at speeds approaching 1600 iso  the speeds are quoted in seconds and fractions so you will have to convert to iso yourself if you are that way inclined night shooting is an exercise in steadyness and the threaded mount is inline with the lens so tripods are easy to attach and use with the camera  the position of the trigger means taht a decent push is needed often spoiling the shot through movement on the tripod  i tended to use the time delay function after lining the shot up  since the exposur time was generally 2 seconds you wouldnt be able to take moment in time shots anyway as you would blur  however if motion blur was wanted for a set time then the lack of a remote may hinder you the flash was good with the red eye reduction setting annoying  3 distinct flashes are used rather than the usual strobe  but effective the viewfinder shows a full picture but it has an obvious border so you will get more than you see  the lcd screen shows the full picture  observed by me not scientifically proved  the viewfinder and lcd screen are served by the same mechanism and therefore cannot be activated at the same time  long exposure shots are restricted to 10 seconds maximum  the sensor simply cannot take long exposure  i typically call long exposure at least 1 minute with traditional cameras taking maybe 30 minutes onwards  this is not a fault of the camera as most digital cameras suffer the same fate of  overheated  ccds  only the eod300 can have long exposures  i have seen a 10 minute exposure picture  for a budget camera 10x optical zoom is terrific and even the autofocus at maximum zoom is quick and efficient  a certain knack needs to be adopted with the camera since the shutter trigger is a two position button  a half press will continually focus and a full press will take the picture  therefore if you simply press the button the shutter will appear to be slow since the focusing mechanism will kick in before the picture is taken  if you are anticipating a fast shot then half hold the button to activate the autofocus then the shutter can be activated quickly  usign this methods the camer was faultless and fast i have never been a fan of megapixels to rate a camera  rather the resolutions on offer are good and true  2048 scale very well   but dont expect many per a 128mb card never mind the bundled 16mb  colour reproduction is faithful on daylight shots and average for evening shots with maybe a hint of overglow battery life is great on rechargeables  i got 300 shots from a set of 2100 nimh before they needed charging and i was using autofocus and zoom a lot  however if you use alkalines then expect 200 before the batteries are drained   note they wont be useless  good enough for remotes or clocks  but they have lost the edge for the drain the camera needs for negative points  the build quality is average  the mechanican shutter jammed on my only 1 week into using it  i couldnt shift between lcd and viewfinder and a heavy press was needed on the back screen to release the shutter  not good  the battery compartment seems very flimsy and i worry about breaking it everytime i use it  and i charge my batteries in a smart charger not internally  no ac supply is included but the majority of people who need one will have a regulated supply to hand anyway the lack of remote function is the only noteable omission from a rather useful bargain camera  ,look around web digital camera look either canon end rebel unfortunately rebel price range buy overall make good choice camera take good picture majority circumstances full control aperture exposure focus wish camera take function wish low light shoot easy option sunset preserve keep warmth picture rather overexpose simulate full light fast move object need good light would expect camera still operate speed approach iso speed quote second fraction convert iso way incline night shoot exercise steaminess treat mount online lens trip easy attach use camera position trigger mean decent push need often spoil shoot movement try tend use time delay function line shoot since exposure time generally second able take moment time shots anyway would blur however motion blur want set time lack remote may hinder flash good red eye reduction set annoy distinct flash use rather usual stroke effective viewfinder show full picture obvious border get see lead screen show full picture observe scientifically prove viewfinder lead screen serve mechanism therefore activate time long exposure shots restrict second maximum senior simply take long exposure typically call long exposure least minute traditional camera take maybe minutes onwards fault camera digital camera suffer fate overhear end end long exposures see minute exposure picture budget camera optical room terrific even autofocus maximum room quick efficient certain knack need adopt camera since shutter trigger two

111,auto, last august we finally got rid of our 1984 chevy eurosport stationwagon the last of its kind  as i waved  bye bye  and my daughter in law took my picture  no tears came  no way  because no longer would that sorry looking thing be sitting in my driveway and have me feeling like one of the fiction folks out of the pages of a carolyn chutes novel  e g  the beans of egypt maine yep that chevy wagon was gone and out of my life forever the next day we picked up a 1999 mazda sx b2500  bare bones  no frills  no bells or whistles pickup truck  with only 4 cylinders  8 spark plugs inside its engine  i was surprised to find just how peppy this thing really was  far peppier than the 4 cylinder ford pinto wagon my husband and i bought back in the mid 70 s also no automatic here  we went with the 5 speed standard  although barebones  it does have an am fm radio and an air conditioner  the instrument panel has a speedometer  odometer  and indicates fuel  oil  water  amp  battery conditions  okay so no climate control like my lincoln  like i said bare bones       it does have duel airbags and the passenger s side can be turned off  which is advisable if putting in a child s car seat  the airbag can be disconnected via an ignition key inside the cab  an excellent feature not only for a child but also for someone like me who is on the short and petite side  and not much bigger than some children are  oil changes are recommended every 5 000 miles  tune ups not necessary for at least 100 000 miles  this little bare bones pickup is fairly inexpensive to drive  as gas mileage is approximately 20 miles to a gal  a plus for those living here in the northeast  especially with connecticut getting hit hard with both rising gas prices  1 50 gal  and heating oil costs  last fill up cost me  256   1 75 gal  the lowest octane rating is recommended when you do fill up  the ride is fairly comfortable unlike my lincoln continental  which has spiffy load levelers to stabilize the ride and costs  500 apiece when they do give out   i ll save that for another review  i don t expect anything like this to happen any time soon with this mazda  besides what do the cost of shock absorbers run for now  i m sure no where near  500  other features on this  bare bones  model are intermittent wipers  non locking tailgate  which has side rails and positions for tie downs  four hooks for tie downs inside the bed and also slots for chrome tie downs on top of the rails  fourteen inch tires that come with steel wheels  we bought snow tires and so far have had no problems getting around on snow covered roads  certainly  this pickup does not have all the bells and whistles but at  11 000 we hope to have this thing running just as long as that 1984 chevy wagon  which we had also bought new  and when i make the monthly payments on this truck  there is no interest attached to these payments  recommended for anyone who wants dependable transportation in a pickup truck     ,last august finally get rid eurosport stationwagon last kind wave bye daughter law take picture tear come way longer would sorry look thing sit driveway feel like one fiction folks page carolina cause novel bean egypt maine yep wagon go life forever next day pick make bare bone fill bell whistle pick truck cylinders spark plug inside engine surprise find puppy thing really far pepper cylinder ford wagon husband buy back mid also automatic go speed standard although barebones radio air condition instrument panel speedometer odometer indicate fuel oil water amp battery condition okay climate control like lincoln like say bare bone duel airbags passenger side turn advisable put child car seat arbat disconnect via munition key inside cab excellent feature child also someone like short petite side much bigger children oil change recommend every miles tune necessary least miles little bare bone pick fairly expensive drive gas mileage approximately miles gal plus live northeast especially connecticut get hit hard rise gas price gal heat oil cost last fill cost gal lowest ocean rat recommend fill ride fairly comfortable unlike lincoln continental stiff load revelers stability ride cost apiece give save another review expect anything like happen time soon make besides cost shock absorb run sure near feature bare bone model intermittent paper non lock tailgate side rail position tie four hook tie inside bed also shots come tie top rail fourteen inch tire come steel wheel buy snow tire far problems get around snow cover roads certainly pick bell whistle hope thing run long wagon also buy new make monthly payments truck interest attach payments recommend anyone want dependable transportation pick truck
112,camera, i bought the camera over 6 months ago and have taken over 1500 pictures  it s a great little camera  my uncle has the sony mavica  and while it seems to have some good features  it s much bigger than the kodak  i like the smaller form factor  the downloading interface is easy  it has usb  and the picture quality  especially outdoors  is great  i would suggest getting a viewfinder on whatever digital camera you buy   the kodak 240 model has one  the viewfinder is especially helpful when it is bright outside  and you can t see the little digital screen  i am part of a search and rescue team  and use the camera outdoors on my search and rescue practices  i ve dropped it several times  and am pretty rough with it  so far  it has always worked well  even after the falls there only 2 downsides i can think of for the camera  one is that it really sucks down batteries  especially if you review pictures on the digital screen   i d suggest getting more than one set of rechargeable batteries as backups  also  sometimes when taking pictures indoors  the flash causes a blue glare on the pics  but this usually only happens when the room is pretty dark and the subject is more than about 5 6 feet away the following statement added after 9 months of use camera still great  but was in the shop for over a month when it just stopped working  acted like the batteries were dead  but even after replacing the batteries it remained frozen and would not work  my sister has a 280  and the same thing happened to hers  i would suggest purchasing an extended warranty if available br br  ,buy camera months ago take picture great little camera uncle sonya mavra seem good feature much bigger today like smaller form factor download interface easy us picture quality especially outdoor great would suggest get viewfinder whatever digital camera buy today model one viewfinder especially helpful bright outside see little digital screen part search rescue team use camera outdoor search rescue practice drop several time pretty rough far always work well even fall downsides think camera one really suck batteries especially review picture digital screen suggest get one set rechargeable batteries back also sometimes take picture indoors flash cause blue glare pick usually happen room pretty dark subject feet away follow statement add months use camera still great shop month stop work act like batteries dead even replace batteries remain freeze would work sister thing happen would suggest purchase extend warranty available br
113,camera, i bought this because the price was super low at  60  and the brand was kodak  true to its name  this kodak camera gives very good quality pictures  i dont think that for home use you need more than 1 megapixel  minimum resolution needed for 4x6 prints is 640x480  thats about 0 3 megapixel  so at 1 megapixel u can have prints 2 orders greater  home users should concentrate more on other features  now this camera features 1  3 picture quality  the lowest quality of 576x432 isnt good enough even for 4x6 print  so is useless  higher and highest quality at 1152x864 are good  the image size is around 300 kb for highest quality  around 150 kb for higher one  and around 50 kb for least one  so on a 16 mb compactflash card  this camera houses a compactflash card slot  you can have around 50 best quality  or around 100 better quality pictures 2  this camera can be hooked to any ntsc tv  tvs found in us  using a video cable thats not available anywhere  except for a few websites  not even kodak online shop has this video cable   atleast i couldn t find one  the price is very low on the sites its available   around 5 bucks  so can t think of why kodak didn t include it in the original pack  also this camera can t be hooked to a pal tv   tvs found in europe and asia  although its canadian version can be  doesn t matter for an american buyer  but is a negative for an indian like me  3 since digital zoom can be taken only at the lowest resolution  its not much  read that  any  use 4 flash can be operated in automatic  on and off mode  this is helpful  default is auto  so this is actually a point and shoot camera  no settings required 5  shutter speed is fixed  thats a low  keep the camera too close  and the contrast is too great most important 6 almost everyone here mentions that batteries run out fast  i was very impressed with the performance of ni mh cells  i bought 4 pairs of duracell 1800mah ni mh aa cells and a duracell charger for 4 aa  or aaa  cells for just  25 from rite aid  so i take turns with 2 pairs  and with each 2 pair i get something like 50 60 photographs  and i use lcd mostly for taking and reviewing the pictures  so i think this is good performance  i guess all that have given negative feedback on battery performance have dealt with alkaline cells  this way i dont need an ac adapter too 7  the pc connectivity is the most negative feature on this camera  it uses an ultra slow serial connection    even more slow on the internal memory     so you have to buy a usb card reader or pc card adapter for faster transfers for the picture quality u can check the page where i have kept my pictures  http www angelfire com weird vivek the first four links lead to thumbnail pages of all the pictures i have taken from this camera my experience  use the flash options intelligently and you will get good pictures  in almost all situations  ,buy price super low brand today true name today camera give good quality picture dont think home use need megapixel minimum resolution need print megapixel megapixel print order greater home users concentrate feature camera feature picture quality lowest quality good enough even print useless higher highest quality good image size around b highest quality around b higher one around b least one mb compactflash card camera house compactflash card slot around best quality around better quality picture camera hook vs find us use video cable available anywhere except webster even today online shop video cable least find one price low sit available around buck think today include original pack also camera hook pal vs find europe asia although canadian version matter american buyer negative indian like since digital room take lowest resolution much read use flash operate automatic mode helpful default auto actually point shoot camera settings require shutter speed fix low keep camera close contrast great important almost everyone mention batteries run fast impress performance ni cells buy pair duracell may ni cells duracell charge ana cells rite aid take turn pair pair get something like photograph use lead mostly take review picture think good performance guess give negative feedback battery performance deal alkaline cells way dont need ac adapt pp conductivity negative feature camera use ultra slow aerial connection even slow internal memory buy us card reader pp card adapt faster transfer picture quality check page keep picture http www angelfire com weird vive first four link lead thumbnail page picture take camera experience use flash option intelligently get good picture almost situations
114,camera, i purchased a digital camera to save costs of developing  and storage space  albums  digital cameras are great for graphic artists  ebay  auction sellers  web designers  and anyone into photography  i liked this camera because of it s ease of use  ability to zoom  i have the choice between taking color photos  b amp w  and even sepia  i can add frames to my pictures  it has many great aspects but when deleting pictures from the camera  or doing anything to them via the software  is very time consuming  if you fill up a disk  give yourself at least an hour to save and delete them from he camera it also uses a lot of battery juice  it does come with a set of regular batteries  and a set of rechargeable batteries  and an adapter  which is great  i suggest you get another set so when it drains the batteries and you need to recharge  you have a spare set to interchange the worst thing about this camera  and it may be the same with others  i do not know  there is a few seconds delay  from the time you press the button and the time the picture is taken  surprisingly enough the delay screws up a lot of pictures  if they re moving  or it s a spur of the moment shot  best if used to take still shots br br  ,purchase digital camera save cost develop storage space albums digital camera great graphics artists bay auction sellers web designer anyone photography like camera ease use ability room choice take color photo amp even septa add frame picture many great aspects meet picture camera anything via software time consume fill disk give least hour save delete camera also use lot battery juice come set regular batteries set rechargeable batteries adapt great suggest get another set drain batteries need charge spare set interchange worst thing camera may others know second delay time press button time picture take surprisingly enough delay screw lot picture move spur moment shoot best use take still shots br

120,camera, there is lots to be said about the sony mavica fd85  first off this camera is very easy to use and what you do not understand the owners manual contains instructions which are very easy to read and understand  this camera is well worth the  500 just to have the floppy access which saves tons of time  you no longer have to connect your camera to a computer it is as simple as putting the floppy into your computer and all your pictures are there ready to be looked at  this feature is also great because you no longer have to take up precious hard drive space to store pictures with the low price of floppies you just store your disk for later viewing  as for picture quality it has 4 settings you can use and all are great quality for being a 1 3 megapixel in the lowest setting which is still great for viewing on a computer you can fit close to 35 pictures on each floppy which is great  the best feature on this camera definately is the battery life  even with the battery that comes with the camera has close to 2 hours of picture time which compared to all my other digital cameras that ran on aa batteries is unheard of to me and saves lots of money for a little extra money a 4 hour battery can be purchased and i definately will making this buy  the only real downsides to this camera i can say arent major at all 1 is the weight it is a little heavy but technology is heavy second thing is the lens cap gets in the way which is just a neucsence more than anything  well you heard my view on this camera and i am a regular person using this not a computer pro i hope this helps in your decision  thankyou for your time ,lot say sonya mavra ff first camera easy use understand owners manual contain instructions easy read understand camera well worth floppy access save tons time longer connect camera computer simple put floppy computer picture ready look feature also great longer take precious hard drive space store picture low price flop store disk later view picture quality settings use great quality megapixel lowest set still great view computer fit close picture floppy great best feature camera definitely battery life even battery come camera close hours picture time compare digital camera run batteries unheard save lot money little extra money hour battery purchase definitely make buy real downsides camera say agent major weight little heavy technology heavy second thing lens cap get way neucsence anything well hear view camera regular person use computer pro hope help decision thankyou time

123,camera, searching for a digital camera can be a nightmare  and i spent the last year trying to find a camera with all the features i wanted at a price i could afford  i have had a  beginner  digital camera for three years now  while it was high end when i got it  it is now  novice  level and was beginning to give up the ghost  it was time to invest in a new digital camera  and i knew exactly which features i wanted  unfortunately  these didn t coincide with my price range  until i found the  toshiba pdr m5    the toshiba pdr m5 is a megapixel digital camera  offering all of the features i wanted for a bargain pricetag  if you are shopping for a digital camera  i would suggest that you approach this scientifically  as the vast number of offerings can just overwhelm you when you start looking  also set out your price range   what you are willing to spend  and what you absolutely cannot go over  budget wise  my criteria  when i was shopping  included  megapixel   high resolution  zoom capability  2x minimum  usb connection  strongly preferred  menu driven  easy to use  fast processing  smartmedia card included  strongly preferred  ac cord included   rechargeable batteries  strongly preferred  all accessories included that i need  total price under  400  refurbished okay if warranted after looking at the features of dozens of different brand digital cameras  i was  quite frankly  overwhelmed and more than a little confused  it was hard enough to compare features within a brand  but comparing several cameras of different makes and models  almost impossible  there are so many different things to consider and minor variations  i finally made up my checklist  above  and started going through all of the options and suppliers  i ll describe the camera itself  then take you through my criteria and the specifications of the pdr m5 step by step here b physical appearance and features  the camera has a silver body  and measures about 5  wide x 3  high x 2 8  deep  and weighs only 11 3 oz  without the battery or smartmedia card  on the front there is the lens  which protrudes from the silver case  an optical viewfinder  and ergonomic grip with a rubber finger rest  on the top is a pop up flash  shutter button and the mode dial  on the back is the lcd display  a backlit data display  zoom controls  menu display macro delete buttons  a rocker button to navigate through the controls with  serves as an enter button also  and the flash timer and image quality control buttons  on the bottom are the battery compartment and the tripod adapter  on one side is the door for the smart media card  which locks shut  and on the other side is a rubberized flap that covers the usb connector  ac jack and ntsc out jack   mega pixel   high resolution  this camera has a 2 14 megapixel 1600 x 1200  or 800 x 600  resolution  i generally use it in the lowest  basic  mode  there are three  sizes  available and i found the 1600 x 1200 images to be far too huge  the image quality even at the lowest settings is fabulous  crisp and clear b zoom capability  this camera has a 3x optical zoom which is equivalent to a 38  115 mm lens  the zoom extends out when in use  and retracts back into the camera when not in use or the camera is turned off  there is also a 2x digital zoom feature  it is worth noting that the lens area sticks out from the rest of the camera all of the time  and is covered with a lens cover when not in use  one fun feature is a 2 5 playback zoom  which lets you look more closely at pictures in the playback mode b usb connection  this may be a petty point  but it was important to me personally  i have several little gizmos attached to my computer and hate kneeling down  trying to switch out the connection for my camera on the back of my computer when i need to change to another input  the usb cord is great  i can just leave it connected all of the time and plug it into my camera to download when needed b menu driven  it was important to me to be able to see  at a glance  exactly what the controls and settings were  i wanted an lcd display  standard on most digital cameras today  that made it very simple for me to set the camera and use it without a lot of squinting at tiny keys  trying to remember which combination to push together  etc  this camera s menu is great  there is a single button  clearly labeled  menu  that i push to bring up the menu  from my menu  i can control the record mode  all settings  self timer  lcd settings  image quality  flash mode  sounds  time  language  playback settings  etc  there are also several buttons that accomplish some of these features if you don t want to do this all on screen  however  i find it simple and easy to just scroll through the menus and select the options i want  and see them confirmed on screen b easy to use  in addition to being menu driven  i wanted a camera that wouldn t baffle me when i picked it up  bear in mind that i used to sell medical equipment  so i m not afraid of technical products  nonetheless  i like a camera i can pick up and understand in a matter of minutes  without spending hours reading manuals or having to read the manual four times just to figure out how to shoot a basic picture the pdr m5 has been outstanding in this area  it is clearly set up  with buttons clearly marked  the on screen displays and a mode dial on the top  the mode dial allows you to select whether you want manual mode  where you control the settings and focus  automatic  autofocus  off  playback or pc download mode  there is a detent at each option so it s easy to turn the dial to the correct setting  and a rubber bezel around the outside so it s easy to grip  there is also a little status display  a data lcd screen  right next to the optical viewfinder that is visible even when the image lcd display screen is off  this shows you the battery level  smart media card state  time  current picture settings and number of pictures remaining  i find myself referring to this all the time b fast processing  many people forget that toshiba is a computer company  and a relatively new entrant to the digital camera market  their first digital cameras were purchased and relabeled with the toshiba name  only with the pdr m4 did toshiba put their own electronics inside  the ultra fast processing speeds on the m5 reflect this  with what is called the  fastest consumer level digicam on the planet  it takes about 2 seconds to boot up at full resolution  and between  8 and 2 seconds between pictures  of course if you really needed faster pictures than that there is a burst mode available that gives you 4 to 16 shots per second b smart media card included   i wanted either a smart media card or floppy disk capability  with the media included in my price  the toshiba pdr m5 price includes a 8 mb smart media card  which allows me to take up to 128 pictures  at the lowest resolution  on one card  there is a 9 mb internal memory  however  this is only for buffering the pictures and there is no internal storage  which surprised me  but is fine now that i understand that  there is also a smart media card adapter that is optional  this lets you put the smart media card right into your floppy drive    ac cord and rechargeable batteries  one of the things that i disliked about my previous camera  the vivitar vivicam 2700  see my review at http research epinions com elec review 2b65 5b6730 38922400 prod4  was that it literally ate batteries  when the lcd screen was on it almost inhaled batteries  even off i could rarely get more than 30 40 images on a four pack of batteries  the pdr m5 has three answers to that dilemma  first is the inclusion of a 5v ac adapter  so you don t have to use your batteries for fixed image shooting and playback downloads  i had to order my adapter for the vivicam separately and it ran about  40  secondly  the battery is a rechargeable lithium  3 7v 1100mah liion  battery pack  included  that lets you take about 160 pictures with the viewfinder on  or 240 pictures with the lcd screen off  i ve never let it run all the way down  but it shows about half charged at 60 80 images left and i generally use the flash and the lcd screen  the battery recharges right in the camera in about five hours  if fully discharged  there is an optional external battery charger that is supposed to be far faster  one hour charging time  and for longer excursions i d recommend an extra battery pack as well  finally you can turn the lcd screen off and this will save power consumption as well b all accessories included that i need  after my experience with the vivicam  i wanted to be sure i didn t have to spend a lot of extra money  after  my purchase to complete my set  the pdr m5 came with everything i needed  although there are some optional accessories i am still considering  the camera ships with  camera  rechargeable lithium ion battery  ac power adapter  8 mb smart media card  shoulder hand strap  cd rom  instruction manual  warranty card  serial cables  ntsc video cables  usb cable and lens cap cover  the rebate form was downloaded from the toshiba website    extra features i didn t expect  as i said  this camera met my requirements  in addition  there were several other features that were above and beyond my requirements  and of course i m thrilled with them  although i haven t figured them all out  these include  lens cap cover   a lens cap cover that covers the  protruding  lens  it is attached by a strap to the camera so you don t lose it  movie capability   this camera has the capability of making short videos  without sound  this amazed me  at this price  the maximum size for any one movie is 8 mb  and time ranges from 30   120 seconds depending on the resolution required  the image quality is lower in movies  full size   320 x 240 and half size   160 x 120 pixels  but it s a fun feature and great to watch  black and white images   this was a surprising feature that i didn t even realize this camera had until i read the manual  i have many times that i d like to get a nice black and white photo  especially for corporate presentations or business use  the pdr m5 has an iso setting that lets you adjust the sensitivity from  the equivalent of iso  100 to 200 to 400 to black and white    burst multi image settings   in the burst mode  you can take 4 to 16 photos per second  these are not sent to the card but are stored in memory  after the burst you select which ones you want and store them to the smart media card  this is a nice mode for a moving object or for kids like mine  who smile and run  this way i can usually get at least one good picture  there is another mode called multiple images that lets you take 16 continuous shots  4 per second  all of the images are saved as one full sized image  this is nice for moving subjects  and my nephew used it to photograph a horse jumping  you cannot  however  use a flash on burst or multi photography  bulb mode   this is a long exposure mode for taking pictures that require several seconds to photograph  an example would be pictures of fireworks at night  you cannot use the flash for this mode either  you can adjust it from 1 second to 8 seconds open  self timer   a simple but nice feature allowing you to take pictures on a timer  you can set the timer for either a 2 second or 10 second delay  and can make movies with the timer as well  macro   a close up mode  allowing the camera to focus on subjects between 1 and 3 feet  normally subjects this close would be too close to focus on  but in the macro mode i can take pictures as close as 5 inches  such as of my kids  and have them be in focus  this is a really nice feature that i didn t expect to find on a camera in this price range  manual mode   if desired  you can set the camera to manual to adjust the white balance  exposure compensation  aperture value and af ae area  i have to admit that i don t know anything about these features and strongly prefer the automatic mode  but far more skilled photographers would no doubt appreciate this feature  ergonomic shape   the camera is more or less molded to your hand  so it is easy to grip  with rubber grips and a natural  right handed  shape that conforms to your hand  it is very lightweight and i find it far easier to hold than my previous digital camera and even my fixed pentax camera  digital zoom   allows the center of the image to be enlarged to twice its normal size  so you can more clearly see the image you are recording  this is nice for taking pictures of objects you know you may crop later  but want to select clearly now  playback zoom   this is a cool feature that allows you to frame in the area of a picture you want to see  then zoom in on that area during playback  this is great for seeing a small piece of an image that you want to see up close  such as a person s face in a distant shot  this is especially useful for burst photography where you are picking whether or not to save images  or if you are near the capacity of your card and want to decide if you should save or delete an image  3 mode display screen   the lcd screen actually has three options  the first is showing the image  with all of the photographic mode symbols  mode  number of shots left  flash  battery  time  date  etc  the second mode is to show the image without any symbols or mode information  and the third is with the screen off  the first two modes are also available during playback  i have found that the information is useful for my first picture than i find it distracting and turn it off    additional lens capability   this camera has an adapter ring attachment on the front  which is a threaded ring  if you wanted to  you could attach an additional lens or optical filter to your camera  red eye mode   the flash can be set in several modes  including automatic  red eye reduction  forced flash  suppressed flash and slow synchro  the slow synchro is good for shooting people at night with a dark background  or where there is a lot of backlighting  etc  white balance   in the manual mode  you can set the white balance  options include automatic adjustment  outdoors  bluish fluorescent light  reddish fluorescent light  and incandescent light  my cousin was quite excited to hear that i had these options  although i again admit i always leave the camera set to automatic b  what i m disappointed in   for the most part i am thrilled with this camera  to be fair  though  there are three things that are disappointing  although i ve learned to work with them  and you should be aware of when you select this camera  these are  shutter lag   there has to be a slight lag between when you hit the shutter and when you take the picture  this allows the camera to focus and then take the picture  if you don t allow for this lag  and just hit the shutter all the way  your images may be out of focus  i have learned to work with this but i must admit it s a pain when i have two little rugrats i m trying to photograph   that extra second it takes to focus can make the difference between having them smiling or not  or in the picture or having run off already  in any case you have to partially depress the button to focus before you fully depress the button to take the picture    off between record  amp  playback   whoever setup the mode dial clearly was more concerned about battery conservation than convenience  the camera has to cycle past  off  to get from  record  to  playback  which is a pain in the rear  i will admit that if you flip it really fast you can usually fool the camera  i like to see the image i just took before i decide if i need another one so i often flip back and forth  it s a minor inconvenience but not one i can t live with  low light focusing problems   the camera focuses optically  not using an infrared beam  i m not sure if this was to improve the processing speed or what  but it means that the camera has difficulty focusing in low light situations  i ve also had some minor problems with distance focusing  but not as bad  again these are not horrible issues  and perhaps if i had paid  800 for the camera i would be more upset  but it s a minor inconvenience  toshiba told me there is a firmware upgrade available but i don t have this yet b  price   the toshiba pdr m5 met all of my requirements  and was well within my price range  the retail price for a brand new pdr m5 is  799  but i have seen this on sale online for  599 and up  i bought mine through ubid for under  400  and there is a  100 mail in rebate as well  this brought my grand total to  296  including shipping   new or refurbished    my camera was refurbished  but with a 90 day warranty  which is long enough for me to determine if there is any major technical glitch with the camera  i have purchased many electronic items refurbished  and have found that new or refurbished  the average time to discover problems is about 2 3 weeks  if they pass this timeline  the next hurdle doesn t show up for over a year  which generally puts them outside the one year warranty anyway  i have purchased coffee makers  computers  monitors  cameras  and other electronic products refurbished without problems in the past  or  as i said  the problems clearly show up in the first 2 3 weeks of use  which is well within the initial warranty period  you  of course  have to decide how much risk you are willing to take for the savings involved b summary  after a year of searching  and watching cameras like the pdr m5 come on the market  but far above my price range  i didn t think i would ever find a camera that met my needs  i was shocked to see the pdr m5 on ubid  and spent several days researching this camera to make sure there weren t any major design flaws i was unaware of  reassured  i snatched up this gem at a bargain price  i have been incredibly impressed with the quality and delivery of this camera  and with its capabilities  i would recommend this to a friend who was shopping for a camera as a great buy  and hope that i will be using my pdr m5 for many years to come for more

126,auto, i first saw what was to become the xg 300 at the philadelphia auto show in 1999  it was then called the equus  i looked curiously at this large  for a hyundai  car sitting on the platform and was disappointed that it was for show only  you could not sit in it  the next year  it had changed names and was available for inspection  i was immediately impressed with the long list of standard features and the sticker price just knocked me out  this year  with the 0  financing  i decided to take a test drive  i am glad that i did  it turned me on to an incredible value  that i am appreciating more with each day i drive it  front and side air bags  traction control  pre tensor seat belts   they tighten to hold you against the seat in a collision  and 4 wheel abs disc brakes make safety one of the big reasons i bought this car  these are standard yet some of these items are not even offered on other makes in this price range  the 5 speed automatic transmission is the smoothest shifting one i have ever had the pleasure to drive  slip it into the  manual  gate and you can control the shift points to give a sportier feel  even in the  manual  gate  however  you cannot overrev the engine or upshift to too high a gear to make the engine drag  as it is electronically blocked  shifts while cornering while in  d  come a bit late  so if you like to push it through the corner a bit  you will definitely need to use the manual gate  the engine itself is extremely quiet during normal acceleration and cruising  even at 70 mph  but exhibits a slight growl under hard acceleration  not at all unpleasant  though  this certainly is not the fastest car on the block  but it is more than adequate for most drivers  the flip side to that is that gas mileage is pretty good for a car of this size  i am averaging in the low to mid 20 s in suburban driving  the 2002 will have a 3 5 liter 194 hp engine upgrade  ride quality is more to the highway cruiser type  hardly a pothole or bump will jar you  handling is a bit mushy due to this  comparable to my chrysler town   country minivan  the complaint about the  little  wheels has been rectified  as the xg300 now comes with standard 16  wheels  michelin tires  i have read some of the other reviews here  and wonder if these people have actually driven the car  one complained of  tight head room with the moon roof  i am 6 5  and usually have trouble fitting into cars of asian descent  this is the only one i have sat in with a moon roof that i can actually fit in with no problems  my head does not touch the roof liner even with the moon roof liner closed  leg room is adequate for me  and someone can actually sit behind me in the back seat  the 6 way adjustable power seat is very comfortable  but lacks enough lateral support for hard cornering  the leather is nice and smells good to me   i don t know where they got the  plastic fumes  from  in fact the interior in general is well put together  the trip computer is kind of useless  giving miles until empty and miles driven as the only useful information  i don t really care about average miles per hour or elapsed time  and would have appreciated gas mileage readings  not included  the miles driven is redundant with the trip odometer on the dash  climate control is very nice  keeping the car either warm or cool accurately  but somewhat confusing to use  air can be fresh or recycled or automatically determined by computer  the confusing part  if fumes are present  i still haven t quite figured out what that means  passenger seat is 4 way power adjustable and both seats are heated   standard on  l  which with leather in a cold climate you really do need  they get very cold to sit on  the  mist  button on the end of the wiper stalk is a nice touch that allows one sweep of the windshield during light rain  the driver power seat will fully retract when the engine is turned off to allow easy entrance and exit  and return to the previous setting upon starting the car  there are 2 presets for the seat and mirrors available   on  l  version this is standard  electrochromic rearview mirror is standard  automatically adjusts for day night electronically  i probably missed some items  but the list is very long  i bought the xg300l version and most everything is standard  with moon roof  heated seats and a long list of standard items on the  l  plus every option available  wind shield for moon roof  cargo net  8 cd changer  and pin stripping the car listed for around  27 000  i paid  23 500 with 0  financing for 5 years  for  660  i got the extended warranty for 10 year  100 000 mile bumper to bumper coverage   usually 5 year  60 000 mile  which is then also transferable to a new owner  you cannot come close to matching that with any other car  i think it is a nice looking car  but that is subjective to each person  and the quality seems to be there so far  i am extremely impressed the fit and finish at this point  i highly recommend this car to anyone who can look beyond the prestige factor of some brand names  ,first saw become x philadelphia auto show call equal look curiously large hyundai car sit platform disappoint

130,camera, this camera is great for home use  it works as a webcam as well as a still cam  it shoots pictures at 640x480 resolution and the pictures are very high quality  i love the cf slot  the only thing is that it s max is 32 mb  i use a cf card all the time and can then take it out and insert it into my pda and view the pictures anywhere  i had a little trouble installing the drivers on my windows xp machine  but finally got it to work  it does have flash  contrary to what the main page says  the internal memory is 8 mb of ram  the problem with ram is that once it loses power  the data is lost  but  they have included a backup battery so that as long as your backup battery is good  you can change your batteries without loss of data  i personally just use my compact flash card since it doesn t require power to retain data and since i can view the pictures on my pda  ,camera great home use work webcam well still shoot picture resolution picture high quality love cf slot thing max mb use cf card time take insert pad view picture anywhere little trouble instal drivers windows machine finally get work flash contrary main page say internal memory mb ram problem ram lose power data lose include back battery long back battery good change batteries without loss data personally use compact flash card since require power retain data since view picture pad
131,camera, the hewlett packard photo smart c200 digital camera is a budget conscious wonder of engineering  i was able to unpack the camera  load the batteries and take pictures within 10 minutes  crystal clear digital images are possible that would amaze the avocational 35mm buff  and the graphic delivery certainly is more than adequate and convenient for internet uploading  my background in conventional photography would typically find me suspicious of the range possible within the digital arena  however i m encouraged with the future of digital photography if hewlett packard was able to develop such a respectable platform at such a reasonable price  the purchaser should be aware of several limitations  i found that the c200 delivers the most effective results when photos are taken on the  quot super fine quot  setting  the camera offers three settings  with progressive improvements in the image  according to the numbers 1 2 or 3  three being optimum  the finer the setting logically the less photos can be stored in the memory card  however this is not a large concern  since the photos can be easily downloaded and the memory card reused  digital cameras  suck the life  out of batteries  so rechargeable batteries and battery charger are a good secondary investment  unfortunately the hpc200 does not come with an ac adapter  although one is available separately  the adapter  sold separately  is  pricey  and fairly specific as far as it s electrical configuration  so the wise consumer may want to avoid a generic model that may damage the camera  finally  and at the low price point this drawback may be forgiven  the manual lighting settings are awkward to manage  since they are arbitrary arrow buttons that cause the photo to become gradually lighter or darker     ,hewlett pack photo smart digital camera budget conscious wonder engineer able unpack camera load batteries take picture within minutes crystal clear digital image possible would amaze vocational mm buff graphics delivery certainly adequate convenient internet unload background conventional photography would typically find suspicious range possible within digital arena however encourage future digital photography hewlett pack able develop respectable platform reasonable price purchaser aware several limitations find deliver effective result photo take quit super fine quit set camera offer three settings progressive improvements image accord number three opium finer set logical less photo store memory card however large concern since photo easily download memory card refuse digital camera suck life batteries rechargeable batteries battery charge good secondary investment unfortunately come ac adapt although one available separately adapt sell separately price fairly specific far electrical configuration wise consumer may want avoid genetic model may damage camera finally low price point drawback may forgive manual light settings awkward manage since arbitrary arrow button cause photo become gradually lighter darker
132,auto, the new chevrolet malibu is a family sedan for people like me who hate family sedans  it offers the convenience of four doors without the  quot boxy quot  look  the model with the rear spoiler is particularly sporty the malibu is comfortable  roomy and handles like its more expensive european counterparts  the steering and suspension are direct  with none of that mushy feeling on the road  it s nicely powered as well  when you step on the gas  this car moves  personally  i think they ve done a far better job with this car than the alero  which i ve driven  it handles better  is more comfortable and is easier on gas  the malibu is available with all the toys at a relatively modest price  fully equipped with leather interior  sun roof and a cd sound system in the low to mid twenties in canada  in my opinion  the malibu is proof that american car manufacturers can build a car to compete with japanese and european family sedans and i hope we will see more such cars in the future     ,new chevrolet malice family sedan people like hate family sedan offer convenience four doors without quit body quit look model rear spoil particularly sport malice comfortable room candle like expensive european counterpart sneer suspension direct none bushy feel road nicely lower well step gas car move personally think do far better job car alert drive candle better comfortable easier gas malice available toy relatively modest price fully equip leather interior sun roof sound system low mid twenties canada opinion malice proof american car manufacturers build car compete japanese european family sedan hope see cars future
133,camera, first  let me start off by saying the the camera is not horrible but not worth its value either picture   the picture quality of the dc4800 is not nearly up to the standards of other 3 megapixel cameras of even less price  i was disappointed with the printable results at even sizes like 5 by 8  at 8 by 10 the picture become pixelated  while that camera s photographs look excellent on the computer  when printed the result is disappointing  i even have a professional photograph printer and the photos are just so so   lcd function menu   the interface of this camera is wonderful  i really like the speed in which you can access basic function  however  the display itself is not up to par and displayed images appear lined and pixelated speed   the camera is by far one of the slowest cameras that i have ever used  it takes seemingly forever to initilize  problems   the lcd of this camera is encased by a metal framing  this framing on my camera began to crack very early on  the cracks encompasses the entire display  let me make my self very clear that i am excessively protective of my equipment and have never dropped  impacted  or forced this camera in any way and the cracks continue  i did some research and hundreds of other have had the same cracking  sadly  kodak just ignores the problem and accuses the consumers of misuse  lets think about this folks  hundreds of people have the same issue at the same place hummm  must be an act of god not covered by the company conclusion   please do not waste you money   ,first let start say camera horrible worth value either picture picture quality nearly standards megapixel camera even less price disappoint printable result even size like picture become pixelated camera photograph look excellent computer print result disappoint even professional photograph printer photo lead function menu interface camera wonderful really like speed access basic function however display par display image appear line pixelated speed camera far one lowest camera ever use take seemingly forever initilize problems lead camera encase metal frame frame camera begin crack early crack encompass entire display let make self clear excessively protective equipment never drop impact force camera way crack continue research hundreds crack sadly today ignore problem accuse consumers disuse let think folks hundreds people issue place human must act god cover company conclusion please waste money
134,camera, i got this camera for about  50 on ebay  it retails for around  140  and have been very happy with my purchase  i ve been wanting to try out a digital camera for some time now  but don t have the  300  to buy a really nice one  this camera is small and easy to pack and takes pretty good pictures  provided the lighting is alright  it comes with some good software as well the main thing this camera lacks is a stronger flash  unless the subject is right in front of you the flash doesn t do much for you  i recommend using this camera for mainly outdoor events  the camera is supposed to double as a video conferencing camera as well  i haven t had much experience using this part of the camera  or other video conferencing units  so i don t have much to say on the subject  i got a very poor  sluggish image but i m trying to figure out if that is my computer s fault or the camera s fault  all in all i m very pleased with my purchase  its quality has surpassed what i was expecting when i bought the inexpensive camera  it has served its purpose in helping me decide if i want to move on to a more expensive digital camera  or just stick with my 35mm  ,get camera bay detail around happy purchase want try digital camera time buy really nice one camera small easy pack take pretty good picture provide light alright come good software well main thing camera lack stronger flash unless subject right front flash much recommend use camera mainly outdoor events camera suppose double video conferencing camera well much experience use part camera video conferencing units much say subject get poor sluggish image try figure computer fault camera fault please purchase quality surpass expect buy expensive camera serve purpose help decide want move expensive digital camera stick mm

136,camera, a digital camera is a huge purchase for most of us  and one purchase where you don t want to go wrong  we researched cameras for weeks  comparing features and abilities  and this is the one we bought  we ve never regretted it  here s what sold us b  usb compatible  b  i can t stress enough how important this is  if you have  or will one day have  usb  you have to get a camera that supports it  we re talking mere seconds for downloads of large graphic files  instead of minutes b  rechargeable battery  b  plug it in and juice it up  why throw away money on batteries  you can even use it while it s charging  this is a must feature  it will save you countless dollars  charges quickly  maybe an hour for from 0  to 100  charge b  lcd  b  yes  you can live without it  but why  see your pictures instantly  and delete the ones you don t like so you can take more  this may use extra battery life  but take the plug in charger with you and it won t matter  an lcd display lets you keep only the photos you want  which is important if you have limited disk space b  zoom  b  you know why this is important  what s cool is that you can also zoom in on the lcd screen and see all areas of your photo in close up  this will show you if the photo is fuzzy or crisp  and let you see facial expressions  even in group photos b  image expert software  b  by far the best software we ve come across  you can use the quick fix feature and then go in and sharpen  deepen  and add color  we like more blue in our photos  also  this software has a great screen saver option   just select an album as your screen saver and you re done  makes it easy to update the photos  too b  video  b  you can actually take videos with this camera   no sound  but it s still fun  the movies go up to 60 seconds  we have captured the first time our infant batted at a toy with his foot  his funny faces while tasting new foods  and even my husband getting 2 ringers while playing horse shoes  we also got some awesome shots of lightning  and you can freeze the panes  but i haven t figured out how to turn those panes into photos  if you even can  you do have to switch modes when recording and viewing videos  which is a little bit of a pain  but not a huge deal  another nice feature   you can turn off the sound  this matters to us because our little guy would stop whatever he was doing when he heard the camera  and we d miss the shot this is a great looking camera and it comes with lots of accessories   recharger  usb cable  strap  lens cover  and 8 meg card  i d definitely recommend getting at least a 32 meg card  too  about  60 when we got ours  64 meg cards are out there or coming soon  and this is noted as being upgradeable to 128 megs by firmware  which is yet another plus the camera didn t come with a case and doesn t fit in most  it s 3  thick  which is too big for most cases we tried  but we found a nice icon one that holds the camera and accessories and is still small enough that it doesn t feel like you re hauling around a video camera we ve noticed only 2 down sides  first  in some lighting  usually soft yellow lights  like those our living room  it s hard to get clear shots  my brother has this camera too  and says he has learned to manipulate the flash so this isn t an issue  my husband and i haven t taken the time to investigate our photography taking as much as my brother has  we just point and shoot and mostly get great pictures  the second thing is that the rubber guard protecting the recharger  usb and serial ports tore off after about a year  we can still affix it to the camera but it is no longer permanently attached  this was truly the only part of the camera that could be considered flimsy  and the guard itself wasn t  just the bottom where it attached for technical info  the official toshiba site is here http www toshiba com taisisd dsc products cameras pdrm5 index htm and the lowdown from a site that our guru brother in law has said is one of the best  when it comes to digital camera reviews http www steves digicams com toshiba pdrm5 html we got this camera during a toshiba promotion offering  100 rebate  so our bottom line was about  550  the list is  799 but yahoo shopping currently shows a few stores that have it under  400  one is listed here  i know nothing about this store  but the price is good so it might be worth investigating   the page says they don t sell any gray market or refurbished items http shop store yahoo com pc4nothing pdr m5 html we ve taken thousands of photos and are extremely

140,camera, when you power the camera up  it takes about 3 seconds to warm up before it s ready to shoot  once it s ready  you push the shutter down halfway to lock the autofocus and then depress the shutter fully  now you have a pic  you can review it on the lcd if you want any where from 2 to 10 seconds  the lcd screen measures 1 5 inches and fairly clear and easy to see but it would have been nice to control the brightness next move inside to take some flash pictures  here you ll use the autofocus illuminator to help the camera focus in low light  there s a small orange light on the front of the camera under the flash  when you focus  it comes on to make it easier for the camera to focus  this eliminates the long focus times that some other camera have in these situations if they can even focus at all  also inside  you ll appreciate the fact that canon put a decent flash on this little guy  it has a working distance of about 13 feet at the wide angle setting picture quality is very good  pictures come out sharp with accurate color tones  i do get red eye sometimes in indoor shots but  not always and  not to the point that i would consider unacceptable  software  etc canon supplies you with two software applications  one their own and the other is arcsoft s  both applications are good for basic image editing but  if you want something more you ll likely use photoshop downloading photo s is pretty straight forward once the software is installed  hook up the computer with the supplied cable to a usb port  flip the mode switch  turn it on  and your computer  pc  will either open the appropriate program or  you ll have to  once the program is open  pick the images you want and  hit file  transfer  that s about it  you can also view images  and movies on a tv with the supplied cable the only other things in the box  aside from the manual  are a 16mb compact flash card and  4 aa batteries  in the highest resolution  you ll get 8 pictures on this card so  you ll probably want to also purchase a 12x 256mb lexar online for  50  the 4aa batteries will last about 100 pics so  consider purchasing  30 rayovac 15min rechargeables also  the batteries and the cf card will set you back about another  80 but  you ll thank yourself later  i would recommend these for anyone purchasing a digital camera  ,power camera take second warm ready shoot ready push shutter halfway lock autofocus depress shutter fully pick review lead want second lead screen measure inch fairly clear easy see would nice control brightness next move inside take flash picture use autofocus illuminate help camera focus low light small orange light front camera flash focus come make easier camera focus eliminate long focus time camera situations even focus also inside appreciate fact canon put decent flash little guy work distance feet wide angle set picture quality good picture come sharp accurate color tone get red eye sometimes indoor shots always point would consider unacceptable software etc canon supply two software applications one arcsoft applications good basic image edit want something likely use photoshop download photo pretty straight forward software instal hook computer supply cable us port lip mode switch turn computer pp either open appropriate program program open pick image want hit file transfer also view image move supply cable things box aside manual mb compact flash card batteries highest resolution get picture card probably want also purchase mb bexar online batteries last pick consider purchase rayovac min rechargeables also batteries cf card set back another thank later would recommend anyone purchase digital camera
141,camera, i bought this camera for two reasons 1  its a kodak  this is a respected name and i felt certain that i would get a good product  2  it came highly recommended by a friend in the computer industry whom i highly respect  armed with this knowledge and a receipt so i could return the camera if it failed to meet my expectations  i just marched in  grabbed one off the shelf and bought it  what i got was far more then i expected  just point and click and you have a remarkable image  this is the most basic application  from there you begin to experiment and find that you can organize your photos user defined folders  there are several focusing methods  light and white balance are selectable or automatically controlled   its up to you  cool bells and whistles  select text and or date to appear on each photo  built in audio recording and playback for each photo  use your camera like a video camera for your computer  i e  internet phone or web camera  this list goes on downsides  there a couple of problems but they seems to be inherent to the digital camera world not just to the kodak dc series  unless you buy the ac adapter you will be spending a lot of time and money changing batteries  and unless you purchase the optional parallel uploading device you will be spending a lot more time waiting for images to upload via the asynchronous port  the usb interface is faster and better then asynchronous data transfer  but the wait time is still somewhat painstaking  what i found best about this product though is not the bells and whistles but the quality of picture i got  we are talking about pixel density that my monitor could not display  with the right printer  i use the epson color stylus 850 1440x750dpi  and  photo quality paper you can truly get amazing clarity photo printouts  in conclusion and to sum it all up i would have to say  kodak   way to go  i have had people ask me where i got my pictures taken and blown up to 8 5  x 11  when i tell them i did it with the kodak dc260 and printed it out in my home office they are blown away   and you will be too br br  ,buy camera two reason today respect name felt certain would get good product come highly recommend friend computer industry highly respect arm knowledge receipt could return camera fail meet expectations march grab one shelf buy get far expect point click remarkable image basic application begin experiment find organize photo user define holders several rouse methods light white balance selectable automatically control cool bell whistle select text date appear photo build audit record playback photo use camera like video camera computer internet phone web camera list go downsides couple problems seem inherent digital camera world today series unless buy ac adapt spend lot time money change batteries unless purchase optional parallel unload device spend lot time wait image unload via asynchronous port us interface faster better asynchronous data transfer wait time still somewhat painstaking find best product though bell whistle quality picture get talk fix density monitor could display right printer use elson color status dip photo quality paper truly get amaze clarity photo printouts conclusion sum would say today way go people ask get picture take blow tell today print home office blow away br
142,camera, i began to do some significant research into digital camera a few weeks ago  i began to solicite the opinions from a lot of my friends on which camera would be the best  and overwhelmingly the response was for the olympus d 340r digital camera so i began to research more information on this camera and on the next generation of it   the d 360l i cant say enough good things about this product  on the medium setting   which allows for 36 pictures on the 8 meg smartcard   both on screen and printed i had a high quality picture  in fact  just printed out of the software from the camera   without any doctoring of the image in photoshop   i was able to get a high quality image straight out of my printer i would spring for the floppy disk adapter when buying this camera  however  the serial adapter that comes with it does not allow for very fast transfers of images  using the adapter is a breeze as of right now  i am on my first set of aa batteries for this camera  as i am not a huge fan of rechargable batteries  i don t see me using anything other than aa batteries with this camera  i have found this camera very easy to operate     ,begin significant research digital camera weeks ago begin solicit opinions lot friends camera would best overwhelmingly response polypus digital camera begin research information camera next generation say enough good things product medium set allow picture meg smartcard screen print high quality picture fact print software camera without doctrine image photoshop able get high quality image straight printer would spring floppy disk adapt buy camera however aerial adapt come allow fast transfer image use adapt breeze right first set batteries camera huge fan rechargable batteries see use anything batteries camera find camera easy operate
143,auto, i m a leaser  i like the write offs  so when i look at for a car i look for instant gratification  i just got out of a bmw 5 series and was looking to downsize  price wise  and this kind of bothered me  i wanted sport but also luxury and i didn t really want to comprise either  i test drove bmw s  mercedes  i even went so far as to drive a boxster a couple of times  but there i had to compromise  i was getting frustrated and confused until  i walked into a landrover showroom looking for an suv for my wife  this place also happened to be a jag dealer and there it was   a black on black x type fully loaded  i had not even considered jag before but my curiosity got the best of me  the front of the car was   well just plain gorgeous   the back however looked   well like a ford contour  talk about mixed emotions  that all went away however once i drove it  lets address the interior first  this was a sport addition and had the really contoured sport seats  which hugged my body and were so comfortable and accommodating   i m 6 1  230lbs and i m no body builder  the gauges were laid out perfectly and the body of the car was tight  the interior luxuries where all jaguar and the connelly leather sure was soft  it just felt great  now it was time to drive  i started the car with a throaty purr of the 3 0 inline 6  just tuff enough sounding to let you know your not in a  cream puff  jag  this was a manual transmission  which is what i was looking for  and it rivaled if not surpassed the shifting of the bmw  i stepped on the gas and was amazed at the zippiness  is that spelled right  of this new jag  this was a car to really drive   it handle superbly with its all wheel drive and the 17  wheels didn t hurt either  it definitely gave the  i m a sport car  impression  yet stopped at light  you can barely tell the car is running  it was responsive  tight  and yet had a refinement of a jag  actually i was a bit surprised at the stiff suspension  i wasn t prepared to feel the bumps in a jag  don t get me wrong  i loved it  i just expected a cushy er  ride  leaving the showroom i thought that this car was as nice as my bmw  1 week later when i had to make my decision  i could not get the way that i felt in the jag out of my head  it coddled you inside and gave you a thrill ride outside  that was my car  i didn t quite get the whole downsizing thing accomplished  sticker on the one i got was  43 500  but i got a great deal on the lease and i got them to throw in a couple of service perks  it has now been 1 1 2 months since a drove it out of the dealer and i still cannot get enough of the comfort and sportiness of this car  i m still not 100  sold on the outside styling but its growing on me and the tinted windows does wonders  this choice definitely makes me happy  however   i have run into slight somewhat minute problems   the computer controlled sunroof has not been right since i got the car   i ve had in twice and expect it to break again  the airbag warning light keeps flashing also  other than that  no complaints  if you are looking for a sporty car with plenty of speed luxury  and is truly  at least now  unique  this is the car for you  ,leader like write look car look instant gratification get bow series look downsize price wise kind gather want sport also luxury really want comprise either test drive bow precede even go far drive bolster couple time compromise get frustrate confuse walk andover showroom look sun wife place also happen jaw dealer black black type fully load even consider jaw curiosity get best front car well plain gorgeous back however look well like ford contour talk mix emotions go away however drive let address interior first sport addition really colour sport seat hug body comfortable accommodation les body builder gauge lay perfectly body car tight interior luxuries january cornell leather sure soft felt great time drive start car throat pure online stuff enough sound let know cream puff jaw manual transmission look rival surpass shift bow step gas amaze happiness spell right new jaw car really drive handle superb wheel drive wheel hurt either definitely give sport car impression yet stop light barely tell car run responsive tight yet refinement jaw actually bite surprise stiff suspension prepare feel bump jaw get wrong love expect bushy er ride leave showroom think car nice bow week later make decision could get way felt jaw head nod inside give thrill ride outside car quite get whole downsize thing accomplish stick one get get great deal lease get throw couple service peak months since drive dealer still get enough comfort shortness car still sell outside say grow tint windows wonder choice definitely make happy however run slight somewhat minute problems computer control sunroof right since get car twice expect break arbat warn light keep flash also complaints look sport car plenty speed luxury truly least unique car
144,auto, where to begin i bought this car on the recommendation of a friend who has a pretty serious love affair with volvo cars  for the first 5   6 months  the car was fine  but then   paint chips  within the first 10 months  i noticed dime sized paint chips on the front of the car  unfortunately  i didn t purchase the clear coat auto bra at the time of original purchase  to me  this was totally unacceptable  i took it to my dealer and had to argue with the service director to get it fixed  paint is not warranted  in fact  they wouldn t fix it at first  it was only when i responded to the volvo service survey with my dissatisfaction that they agreed to fix the paint chips  during my original conversations with curtis at rickenbaugh volvo  he indicated that the problem was likely my fault  asking if i follow other cars too closely headlights  the headlights go out about every 6 months  annoying brakes  the car was in for work on the brakes twice within 34k miles  the power assist on the brakes failed at 15k miles  not so good when you live in the mountains  then  the rear pads wore out at about 30k miles  rickenbaugh volvo service  mark or jim  quoted me  460 to replace the rear brakes  a service guy in vail  where everything is twice as expensive as the real world  charged me  180  and  he told me that i could drive at least another 5k miles on what i had   volvo made it sound like my car would be unfit for the roads unless i had the brakes replaced immediately check engine light  the check engine light came on randomly during the two years that i had the car  this light required me to take the car in for service twice service light  the service light comes on every 7 500 miles  annoying  last time i took the car in  i asked them to permanently disable the light or set it at 30 000 miles  they said they couldn t do that  which i don t really believe  i mean  c mon  you can disable you daytime running lights and your airbags  but you can t disable the service light road noise  sounds like your drag racing a mack truck when you are on the highway  i took a roadtrip with a friend once  and the wind and road noise on the passenger side were so unbearable  that we had to stuff pillows up against the passenger window to buffer the noise tires  i needed new tires way too early  25   30k miles  i rotate and balance my tires religiously back hatch  the plastic molded rear hatch is supposed to be black  after about 10 months  it had oxidized to a cloudy gray  it looked bad  and  the button you press to open the hatch was cracked  i estimate in about another year  it will break off completely handling in snow  forget about it  this car was sold to me as a car that would perform well in the snow  i ve never gotten stuck  but i have definitely had some concerns on snowy days  bottom line  the car was in for service 7 times in two years  twice  the volvo dealer  rickenbaugh volvo in denver  made a smirky  smart alek comment about how the problems were the fault of my driving  paint chips  i must follow too closely  brakes pads wearing out  i must brake too hard  funny  i never had problems like that with the previous cars i ve owned  a honda civic for seven years and a chevy blaze for three years gimme a break  i wouldn t recommend this car  any volvo  or rickenbaugh to my worst enemy the best part of the story is that on the last service survey  i gave volvo rickenbaugh the poorest rating possible  and they never called me back  i guess they are content to just blow off my bad experience really  it no longer matters  i traded in this unreliable and chattering car for a honda just this week  ,begin buy car recommendation friend pretty serious love affair vulvo cars first months car fine paint chip within first months notice

145,auto, i purchased this car about 8 months ago and must say i am totally pleased with it  i had a 2000 honda civic ex before but needed something with 4 doors and having the rear hatch sold me on the spectra  with the rear seats folded down there is plenty of room for cargo  i am not here to bash the civic but i have to say that overall the kia outperforms the civic easily  that might be hard for some of you to believe but seriously drive a civic and then compare a spectra  the one thing that impresses me the most about the spectra over the civic is its ease to drive  with the honda i had to rev the heck out of the car to extract any type of decent speed  with the kia and the close gear ratios of the 5 spd transaxle you can drive moderate and still achieve excellent acceleration  i just got tired of having to drive the civic so hard around town  the way the spectra handles is another strong point  with a lotus tuned suspension and front and rear anti sway bars  the spectra remains composed and stable in corners  the only minus i can find is the tires which just don t have enough traction and side stability for me  in fairness though i had the same issue with the honda and after replacing the firestones with yokohamas it totally changed the manners of that car  and i suspect the same with the kia  the brakes work very well with no fade after several hard stops  my spectra does not have anti lock brakes and so far i have not locked any of the wheels in hard braking inside the spectra is quite comfortable for this class of car  the seats are so much better than the civic  i used to hate to take the honda on long trips because of its hard flat seats and the material after 6 months started wearing out on the civic  the seat material and cushioning is definately higher quality on the kia  the dashboard on the spectra is attractive and easy to see  all the controls are easy to get to  the only places that kia skimped some seem to be the plastic door panels and the headliner and carpet seem on the cheap side but hey this is a under  11 000 car one other thing to point out if you like doing your own engine service is that the 1 8l engine is quite easy to work on  i have changed the oil and filter and didn t even need a filter wrench to remove the old filter  just reached down behind the engine and spun it off by hand  everything else is pretty easy to get to as well overall i must say that this is a great little car and as far as some of the other reviewers have said about kia s reliability as they get older  take a look on the road and see how many ford festiva s and ford aspires  both made by kia for ford  and you may be surprised  most of those cars are over 10 years old and still run great  i have known several people with them that say they are very happy  ,purchase car months ago must say totally please hand civic ex need something doors rear watch sell specters rear seat fold plenty room cargo base civic say overall kit outperform civic easily might hard believe seriously drive civic compare specters one thing impress specters civic ease drive hand rev neck car extract type decent speed kit close gear ratio sad transaxle drive moderate still achieve excellent acceleration get tire drive civic hard around town way specters candle another strong point lot tune suspension front rear anti sway bar specters remain compose stable corner minus find tire enough traction side stability fairness though issue hand replace firestones yokohama totally change manners car suspect kit rake work well fade several hard stop specters anti lock rake far lock wheel hard break inside specters quite comfortable class car seat much better civic use hate take hand long trip hard flat seat material months start wear civic seat material fashion definitely higher quality kit dashboard specters attractive easy see control easy get place kit skip seem plastic door panel headline carpet seem cheap side hey car one thing point like engine service engine quite easy work change oil filter even need filter french remove old filter reach behind engine spin hand everything else pretty easy get well overall must say great little car far review say kit reliability get older take look road see many ford festive ford aspire make kit ford may surprise cars years old still run great know several people say happy
146,auto, last year i decided to go back to school and finish my ph d  knowing that this would require at least three years of  quot living like a student quot  on a very fixed income  i knew it was time to trade in my last car for one that was more reliable  after a fair amount of reading in various publications  i narrowed the list of potential vehicles based upon price  maintenance records  driving costs  repair costs  etc  the final candidates were early to mid 90 s maximas  several makes of acura and mazda  and the mitsubishi diamante  as far as established reputations  published or otherwise  all were very competitive  that is  until price comparisons were made  in a number of instances  i found diamantes at half the price of competitors in similar condition  for me  the choice was obvious  i bought a 1992 mitsubishi diamante  v6 single cam in very clean condition with 112k miles for  5800  it now has 128k miles in the year that i ve owned the car  i have replaced an exhaust component  cost   100  replaced the timing belt  routine maintenance at 120k miles  cost   375  four oil changes and a tune up  i have also replaced a headlamp bulb  cost   3  the same tail light bulb twice  cost   2 each time  and both reverse lights have gone out  perhaps indicative of a small electrical problem despite proper maintenance  the car is sluggish on hills  feeling as though the timing is always off a bit  hesitating until rpm s are above 3000  on the freeway  this usually means the car down shifts hard  from about 2700 rpm s to 4000 rpm s  a bit worrisome for a transmission with nearly 130k  the front brakes shimmy slightly other than this  the car is a dream  very comfortable  although a few more inches of head room would be nice  very quiet  and very stylish inside and out  the car is very stable on the road  having a heavy car feel  yet can be incredibly nimble with its sensitive steering and low stance  i love the instrument layout and the interior styling  many friends have guessed the price at more than twice what i paid for it  if i could have given one piece of advice to mitsubishi when building this car   quot give it more low end power quot  the car easily exceeds 100mph on the freeway  but getting their can take a little run up  unless you don t mind redlining  the car has plenty of power  once i m above about 3100 rpm s  below that is where the lack of low end torque is noticeable     ,last year decide go back school finish oh know would require least three years quit live like student quit fix income know time trade last car one reliable fair amount read various publications narrow list potential vehicles base upon price maintenance record drive cost repair cost etc final candidates early mid maximus several make acute make mitsubishi diamante far establish reputations publish otherwise competitive price comparisons make number instance find diamantes half price competitors similar condition choice obvious buy mitsubishi diamante single clean condition miles miles year own car replace exhaust component cost replace time belt routine maintenance miles cost four oil change tune also replace headlamp bulb cost tail light bulb twice cost time reverse light go perhaps indicative small electrical problem despite proper maintenance car sluggish hill feel though time always bite hesitate rum freely usually mean car shift hard rum rum bite wearisome transmission nearly front rake shiny slightly car dream comfortable although inch head room would nice quiet stylish inside car stable road heavy car feel yet incredibly nimble sensitive sneer low stance love instrument layout interior say many friends guess price twice pay could give one piece advice mitsubishi build car quit give low end power quit car easily exceed may freely get take little run unless mind recline car plenty power rum lack low end true noticeable
147,auto, i purchased a brand new bright red truck in november 1995 my husband said   not another red truck  yes  i like red  and i like trucks i had brought home a darker blue truck  but it was automatic  power windows  and other frilly stuff that i didn t want or want to pay extra for  my truck had the following features 6 cylinder  standard transmission  5 speed  anti lock brakes  back sliding window  long bed  a c  power steering  and a bed liner what i liked about this truck  at the time i bought it  was that we could all fit into it  however  for my older kids  the fold down jump seats in the back section were uncomfortable on long trips  the last big trip was from tennessee to oklahoma and then back  my son at the time was 15 and my daughter was 12  they were most uncomfortable and had to take turns riding up front  and i liked the price  it cost  12 799 with all the financial stuff  this was the third vehicle that i bought at  woody anderson ford  in huntsville  al  and if i still lived there  i probably would have traded it there and bought another ford product i was faithful about regular maintenance  but this silly truck had a mind of its own  first it was the door open chime it just would not shut off  back to the dealership  it was covered under the warranty  then the wipers went off on their own back to the dealership  covered by warranty  by this time i was wondering if i had made a good decision about this truck  then the interior light would not shut off  my husband just got a potholder from the kitchen and yanked the bulb out  he was beginning to be frustrated by constant trips to the dealer for little electrical repairs i noticed a smell around 35 000 miles or so  something was hot under my truck  i took it in and asked them if there was anything under there that might get hot during driving  they checked the radiator  and other items like brakes etc but not the problem  after the big trip to oklahoma  it finally broke  and it was a carrier bearing  my mechanic basically told me that this was a design flaw since the drive shaft was not so long  it didn t really need to be built like this  just another moving part to break once all of the electrical problems were repaired and the carrier bearing was repaired  the truck was very reliable for 120 000 miles  and a trip to south carolina  myrtle beach  at that time it was traded for a much more comfortable vehicle for our growing family of 5  we bought a  plymouth grand voyager   van  see my review on it please my truck was not a reliable vehicle in ice it froze to the ground and we could not budge it no matter what we tried hahahhaha only in tennessee right  okay  so maybe it was built on a monday  maybe it was just that model year  but i did not buy another ford truck and i had owned 2  so maybe i ll let fords rest and get a toyota or a chevy next truck purchase  ,purchase brand new bright red truck november husband say another red truck yes like red like trunks bring home darker blue truck automatic power windows frill stuff want want pay extra truck follow feature cylinder standard transmission speed anti lock rake back slide window long bed power sneer bed line like truck time buy could fit however older kiss fold jump seat back section uncomfortable long trip last big trip tennessee oklahoma back son time daughter uncomfortable take turn rid front like price cost financial stuff third vehicle buy wood anderson ford huntsville al still live probably would trade buy another ford product faithful regular maintenance silly truck mind first door open chime would shut back leadership cover warranty paper go back leadership cover warranty time wonder make good decision truck interior light would shut husband get potholder kitchen yankee bulb begin frustrate constant trip dealer little electrical repair notice smell around miles something hot truck take ask anything might get hot drive check radiate items like rake etc problem big trip oklahoma finally break carrier bear mechanics basically tell design flaw since drive shaft long really need build like another move part break electrical problems repair carrier bear repair truck reliable miles trip south carolina marble beach time trade much comfortable vehicle grow family buy plymouth grand voyage van see review please truck reliable vehicle ice freeze grind could budge matter try hahahhaha tennessee right okay maybe build monday maybe model year buy another ford truck own maybe let ford rest get tooth next truck purchase

149,camera, after looking through a plethora of digital cameras at my local compusa  i chose casio s qv 8000sx  i selected this model for several major reasons  one the camera is reasonably priced  especially when compared to its ling list of features  and talking about features  the qv 8000sx has a laundry list full of them  it has a wonderful 8x zoom  color selection modes that even allow a sepia print setting  and probably the most important feature  very high picture quality  another feature which i found particularly appealing is the screw mount on the lens  going back to my 35mm roots  i like the idea of being able to add a filter to protect the lens proper the only feature missing from this excellent unit is an ac adapter  this has to be purchased separately  but apart from that  it s a great camera at a great price br br  ,look plethoric digital camera local corpus choose case iv select model several major reason one camera reasonably price especially compare long list feature talk feature iv sundry list full wonderful room color selection modes even allow septa print set probably important feature high picture quality another feature find particularly appeal screw mount lens go back mm root like idea able add filter protect lens proper feature miss excellent unit ac adapt purchase separately apart great camera great price br

151,auto, ok this review may not be all that great  but worthwhile decent  i bought this car around december of 1999 from an arabian individual  it was salvaged with 88 000 miles  at the time i didn t know what salvaged meant when i saw it on the dmv papers  then when the insurance explained the disadvantage of it  i was in serious anxiety  i bought this car for 5 800  where it was listed for 6500  but made a bargain  and where did i get that kind of money  from totalling my mother s 94 nissan sentra and i was at fault  anyhow  how is this mazda salvaged  the owner said it used to be stolen with the leather stripped and driver door broken and was hotwired  that s all the retailer said  i bought it anyway  smart move huh  for some time problems occured  i had a rebuilt transmission which killed  2 500 out of me the most and has caused drama  i had rebuilt front left and right drive axles costing half a thousand dollars  rear sway bar left link replacement which less than a couple hundred  two and a half years later i had an engine oil leak  cuz my dumb self was using valvoline high mileage oil and was kinda overfilling the oil  and that was 400 bucks  sooner or later i had a coolant leak  it was probably a sign to change my timing belt and water pump  so therefore i had my timing belt and water pump service after noticing coolant leakage  then another problem days later after the service  except this will shock you  my car just died out on the freeway at 65 75mph with the dash lights litted on and the hold light blinking  kinda difficult to start the car after pulling to the side off the pavement  but gave it a couple of minutes resting and got it running again  this happend to me three times  so took it in for service and they recommend new spark plugs  air filter  distributor and rotor cap  and they say i went 3000 miles over since my last oil change  and transmission fluid was red than usual so they drained and filled fluid at the time which was right every 30 000 miles and i believe its been 24 30 thousand miles after getting the rebuilt transmission  for a whopping  2400  so i brought it to be serviced again  then i got the car back  and it died again on the freeway    its such a disgrace for a new looking car to do that  so as of today  5 6 02  my car is in the shop again  but free diagnose of the engine problem but now they re making me pay a diagnose fee of the hold light coming on as a sign of a transmission problem and i have just had a rebuilt trans 2 years ago and its probably been just 24 30 thousand miles on it  everything shifts fine and all i just don t wanna pay another    2500 again  ahhhhhh damn mazda to hell is this car japanese or american  when you start the ignition on a honda  acura  nissan  lexus  toyota  mitsu  and so on  except on a mazda  dont their startup  rythm seem to sound alike  the rhythm is slow  on a mazda it sounds like an american starter  where the rythm sounds fast  i noticed that the ford probe is exact to a mazda 626 or mx6  can anyone tell me if this car is actually a ford  i saw a ford commercial and like other brand logos appeared which means its made by ford  even mazda  and is ford reliable in some ways or not  also  my friend also owned a v6 626 but 2 years newer  and her car had problems too  except not as much as i have  she has had timing belt and water pump service already  and now she has to worry about the axle boots and axles which went out after having the water pump and timing belt service  fortunately  her car was in new condition with a clean history title  but she dislikes it and she has already traded it in i don t understand why they permit salvaged cars to sell  don t they know that insurance won t cover a salvaged car fully  they should just keep the car at the junkyard for dismantling the parts to replace other parts and thats it nothing more nothing less i also have doubts that anyone will buy this car  i have close to 3 500 of repairs done from bringing the car into the dealership from day one  would anyone buy it for 6 900 for the sake of goodwill and charity  i would encourage slow steady careful local drivers to think about it  i do need the money  it just sucks how this scarlet letter a salvaged title makes it cursed  if i ever get it sold for enough or if pick and pull buys it for a decent amount  i ll put that money as a down payment on a used but reliable japan import car  and if i ever get a job  make monthly payments on a loan as well to the car i wished i have done this type of research with used car reliability guides and epinions in the first place  but now its too late but now i know  do not get a mazda  even if you a racer enthusiast going for the rx 7  get rid of it and get a true japanese car  like acura or honda  toyota or lexus  and infiniti or nissan  mazda is ford  and f o r d   found on the road dead ,ok review may great worthwhile decent buy car around december arabian individual savage

152,camera, i received this camera as a gift  i already own a polaraid pdc 700  a nice  but fairly featureless camera  what i like about this camera are the features  zoom lens  dual compact flash cards  short video and time lapse photography  and the general feel  which is more like a camera than a lot of models  what i dislike about the camera is  1  not having an ac adapter which is a  69 extra  say what   2  the unexplainable delay in the shutter when taking flash pictures  it s like  quot click  nothing happens  i must not have turned it on  then flash quot  this makes the camera almost unsuitable for anything but still life inside  what i hate about the camera is that i cannot get the software included for downloading the pictures to work  after several attempts i called the panasonic help line and was flicked off after a brief attempt to help me   quot you should try it on another computer or call microsoft quot  now which of my dozen computers should i try next  i am able to download using the included adobe software  but since it wants to save the pictures in a proprietary format  it s a long and tedious process to  quot export quot  each picture to a more standard jpeg format  i will be getting a flash card downloader which hopefully will solve the problem br br  ,receive camera gift already polaraid nice fairly featureless camera like camera feature room lens dual compact flash card short video time lapse photography general feel like camera lot model dislike camera ac adapt extra say unexplainable delay shutter take flash picture like quit click nothing happen must turn flash quit make camera almost unsuitable anything still life inside hate camera get software include download picture work several attempt call panasonic help line flick brief attempt help quit try another computer call microsoft quit dozen computers try next able download use include adore software since want save picture proprietary format long tedious process quit export quit picture standard peg format get flash card download hopefully solve problem br

154,camera, with digital cameras prices falling so rapidly and often  it is a shame that every one does not have one yet  kodak has one model  dc 280  that will meet the demands of nearly everyone and not draw a vacuum on your wallet  what would appear to be a fair quality 35 mm camera is actually a superb digital camera the dc280 by kodak offers resolutions of 1 760 by 1 168 or 896 by 592 pixels  the images are extremely sharp and well focused  i was truly impressed with the quality of shots taken both inside and outdoors  while i prefer a higher storage capacity   i have seven kids  the 8mb  compactflash  memory card allows up to 97 standard or 12 higher resolution shots  usually more than enough for my group shots  the simple design  compact chassis  and comfortable size belies it s durability  i even allowed the kids to take shots with it  the camera took the families antics on and continued to produce high quality shots even after a few drops and spills  the dc 280 is loaded with features many cameras do not offer  2x optical zoom provides excellent detail  the 1 8 inch lcd screen is bright and clear enough for shot selection in any light  and there are a large number of flash options which make for super special effects  included with the dc280 are adobe s photodeluxe 3 1 and pagemill 3 0 software  both provide easy picture editing and correction  which are rarely needed  kodak also included their own special drivers to allow you to upgrade your system for proper operation with the dc 280  while i prefer the cd or disc storage of the sony mavicas  the kodak dc 280 connects to your pc via usb  this is a much more rapid file transfer as compared to the old serial port of yesteryear  i wished that the battery life could be a bit more stout for the dc 280  i found myself forced to swap batteries after only 280 pictures  fortunately i carry extras around because of digital cameras being so battery hungry  the best feature is the  bang for your buck  the dc 280 is now fetching a price of  or around  350 dollars  figure in the cost of film and processing and you will pay for the camera in a year  and i do not think that you can get a better quality camera on the market for a price this low  not yet anyway  ,digital camera price fall rapidly often shame every one one yet today one model meet demand nearly everyone draw vacuum wallet would appear fair quality mm camera actually superb digital camera today offer resolutions pip image extremely sharp well focus truly impress quality shots take inside outdoor prefer higher storage capacity seven kiss mb compactflash memory card allow standard higher resolution shots usually enough group shots simple design compact class comfortable size belief disability even allow kiss take shots camera take families antic continue produce high quality shots even drop pills load feature many camera offer optical room provide excellent detail inch lead screen bright clear enough shoot selection light large number flash option make super special effect include adore photodeluxe pagemill software provide easy picture edit correction rarely need today also include special drivers allow upgrade system proper operation prefer disc storage sonya magical today connect pp via us much rapid file transfer compare old aerial port yesteryear wish battery life could bite stout find force swap batteries picture fortunately carry extra around digital camera battery hungry best feature bang buck fetch price around dollars figure cost film process pay camera year think get better quality camera market price low yet anyway

156,camera, i am not new to digital cameras and  in a way i feel better equipped to explore the features of this camera now that i ve used another one extensively  let me state right off the bat that if you aren t willing to give the manual a fair perusal  then this is probably not going to be a good camera for you my entry into the world of digital cameras came through an agfa e780 camera  while this was an excellent introductory camera  it lacked zoom capabilities and the picture quality peaked out at 3 x 5 photos  i loved my little agfa  don t get me wrong  it s just that i feel i have grown up now and i want a toy with more bells and whistles  the olympus d 490 was the perfect  next step  for me one of the reasons i chose this camera over others was the price to features ratio  in my opinion  the olympus d 490 offers features comparable to some of the higher end cameras without the higher end price tag feature highlights  not an all inclusive list b 1 8 inch color lcd monitor  the monitor on this camera is very sharp  the display is crystal clear and it is very easy to determine if you ve gotten the shot you wanted  while most digital cameras have an lcd screen these days  not all screens are created equal  the clarity on this one is one of the better ones i ve seen b 2 11 megapixel ccd for photo quality output  the higher megapixel allows for larger high resolution pictures  i have taken a couple of really nice landscape shots  printed them at 8 x 10 on my inkjet printer  framed them and hung them on the wall  i am exceptionally pleased with the quality  even up close there is very little  almost none  graininess to be seen b 3x optical zoom with 2 5x digital zoom  this is one of the main features for which i bought the camera  the 3x optical zoom is perfect for scooting in on the squirrel in the yard or moving out to take in the  big  picture  i haven t used the digital zoom much as it requires switching from the optical viewer to the lcd  i just don t care to take pictures that way and i find that extra step not worth the effort  the picture quality degrades only slightly when using the digital zoom  so it is handy to have when you need it  but for the most part  the optical zoom is really quite adequate b sequential shooting capability  this is a fun feature that allows you take a series of quick pictures without waiting for the camera to write them to the memory card  i haven t used this feature much  but it s pretty good for photographing and active child or pet  out of the series  you are bound to get one good shot b manual iso settings  being an extreme amateur  this is not a feature that i ve played with much  i do understand the different iso settings  auto  100  200  and 400  but i haven t found any reason to want to switch from auto since the camera seems very adept at determining available light and adjusting appropriately   quicktimetm movie mode  this is one of my favorite features  while stills are super  there is nothing more fun than being able to send a short film to grandma showing the kiddies blowing bubbles or falling in the snow  the manual says that the camera is capable of filming up to 15 seconds  on the included 8mb memory card  but i often find that a 6 or 7 second video is all i really want to capture a moment b self timer with 12 second delay   this is another feature i don t use often  but i have used it and it is handy at times when i decide to come out from behind the shutter  i really prefer to be behind the scenes documenting everything  but once in awhile i set the camera on top of the tv and jump in the picture another  pro  in my opinion  that seems to be  con  with others  is the fact that this camera uses the serial port for connection to the computer  i know usb is faster  a usb cable is available for this camera  but doesn t come with it  from now until 5 31 01  olympus is offering a usb smartmedia reader for free with proof of purchase  however  i have an older pc and it did not come with usb capabilities  i don t have a usb port  i know i could upgrade  and i probably will someday  but i don t care to be forced into it  this camera came with a serial port cable that plugs into the camera for picture transfer  it s slow  but it works and i m content with it the camera came with an 8mb smartmedia card and long lasting lithium batteries  the batteries are great  but i wish they were rechargeable  i have more in the wings  though  that are  the 8mb smartmedia card is okay  but not great  i have two other 8mb cards  though so i can generally get all the pictures i want on a day s outing  i d need more  though  if i were going to be out where i couldn t download  of course  there is always the option to use a lesser resolution  but that would defeat the purpose of having a megapixel camera in the first place overall  my favorite part about this camera is the handling  an hour with the manual greatly improved my ability to manipulate the features and navigate through the menus  the menu options vary depending on whether the camera is off or on and i still get confused sometimes when looking for a specific option i would not recommend this camera to a digital beginner  i think it would be daunting and frustrating  my husband  a digital beginner  would concur  i love it  though  and it makes me feel like getting out and taking pictures  this camera is ready to use right out of the box but until you ve read the manual  you will miss a lot that this camera has to offer b how it compares  back to my little agfa 1 being a 1 megapixel camera  the agfa had a higher yield on the 8mb card  this 2 megapixel tiger eats up media space  naturally 2 the flash was slow to warm up on the agfa  this flash is ready to use the moment you open the flash housing  which has to be done manually 3 the agfa had a fixed focus and fixed iso setting  great for general purpose use  but i do enjoy the flexibility of the auto iso and zoom capabilities of the olympus 4 both cameras offered serial port connection with optional s video port for tv display  no change there 5 the agfa shut itself off eventually once it sensed it was being ignored  the olympus has that capability but you don t realize it until you get into the software to set the camera settings  it even has variable settings  good feature 6 the optical viewer on the agfa was centered on the body  this caused you to place your nose print prominently on the lcd screen  ugly smear  the olympus is offset to the left and is much cleaner to use 7 the olympus also offers and adjustment on the optical viewer to better align the view with the lens  in case you keep cutting uncle harold s head off overall  i am proud to have traded up to my olympus  i am thoroughly pleased with camera as a whole and my only objection was the size of smartmedia card they chose to send with it  compared to the 2mb card that came with the agfa  though  i suppose i m not too disappointed a final note others have complained about the way the camera closes and turns off  in order to close the camera  you have to slide the lens door toward the lens almost but not quite touching  the lens will then retract and you can finish closing the door  it is a little awkward at first  but it is really not as bad as all that  however  my husband  who works second shift  did wake me up in the middle of the night the first night we had the camera  he had opened it but couldn t figure out how to close it i feel like i am probably forgetting something major  this camera is so feature packed and versatile that it is impossible to cover everything here  that s why they enclose a 140 page manual  while it might not be the  choice of the pros  and it might be a bit challenging to the beginner  is it certainly ample camera for this intermediate level user  i love it and i m proud to have it for examples of some of the pics taken with this camera  go to http community webshots com

158,camera, ok  you should really read this epinion if you are considering entering the digital camera sphere  i bought my polaroid pdc 700 through amazon for  219  it came with carrying case and strap  4 duracell ultra batteries  serial cable  video cable  camera to tv  and ac adapter  the software disks are photomax imagemaker and photomax pro  the kit also included a very limited manual  i would strongly recommend that you go to the polaroid web site and download the entire 58 page manual  it fills in all the gaps in the learning curve and does it well this was my first digital camera purchase  i am an experienced photographer working in conventional film media and favor minolta and canon  but after a great deal of research  the pdc was the clear choice for entry level digital  it has a 1024 x 768 matrix and the image quality is very good  particularly when viewed on a 25 quot  television screen  the lens optics are excellent by any standards  and the shutter is surprisingly fast  aperture is f 3 5 and speed roughly equivalent to to iso 150  in it s highest resolution mode  xga at 1 8 compression  its storage is limited to 12 images  but i find 1 15 perfectly satisfactory for home use  that will give you 25 photographs using the internal 4mb memory  you can always transfer images to a memory card and keep right on going ease of use is excellent  trust me  i do not grasp new concepts like a 20 yo  and this little camera is a breeze  don t believe all the warnings about rapid battery depletion  yes  they go fast  but i have over 100 images on the original batteries  just use the ac adapter whenever possible  especially for downloads and times went the lcd is on in live action  like setting up macro photographs  some reviews also criticize download speed  ok  it is a little slow on the serial cable  but might be faster using usb the software is easy to load and works well  image manipulation is simple and fun you will have a blast creating screen savers and greeting cards right in your own back yard  but it could be more versatile for really fancy adjustments of lighting and contrast  polaroid has outstanding customer support and the help line is readily available if you need  summary  buy this little camera  no i am not and never have been an employee or shareholder of polaroid  i just like this thing  it is perfect for on line auctions  it does exactly what it says it will do  does it better than others in the same price range  and will serve you very well as the technology evolves br br  ,ok really read opinion consider enter digital camera sphere buy polaroid amazon come carry case strap duracell ultra batteries aerial cable video cable camera ac adapt software disk potomac imagemaker potomac pro kit also include limit manual would strongly recommend go polaroid web site download entire page manual fill gap learn curve well first digital camera purchase experience photographer work conventional film media favor minorca canon great deal research clear choice entry level digital matrix image quality good particularly view quit television screen lens optic excellent standards shutter surprisingly fast aperture speed roughly equivalent iso highest resolution mode ga compression storage limit image find perfectly satisfactory home use give photograph use internal mb memory always transfer image memory card keep right go ease use excellent trust grasp new concepts like little camera breeze believe warn rapid battery repletion yes go fast image original batteries use ac adapt whenever possible especially download time go lead live action like set micro photograph review also criticize download speed ok little slow aerial cable might faster use us software easy load work well image manipulation simple fun blast create screen saber greet card right back yard could versatile really fancy adjustments light contrast polaroid outstanding customer support help line readily available need summary buy little camera never employee shareholder polaroid like thing perfect line auction exactly say better others price range serve well technology evolve br
159,camera, this is my 5 year old s third digital camera  the first two  jamcam jr  jamcam 2  were just too darned cheesy and hard to use   who would have thought it  a kidcam being hard to use  after those experiences with kidcams  i wanted to get him a low end real camera  not a toy  he s been using my canon powershot s10 since he was 2  and loves it  a new camera for him didn t have to be quite that good  but it needed to have an lcd display  it needed to have a flash  it needed to take decent pictures  it needed to use replaceable media  and it needed to be relatively cheap this camera fills that bill nicely when i first got it i tried to feed it alkalines  bad move  brand new alkalines show dead almost instantly  i read up on battery characteristics and bought some nimhs  and their life has been perfectly acceptable  i haven t tested how long they live   obviously that ll depend on how much you use the lcd and how much you use the flash   but it hasn t been a problem so far if you have windows xp  me  maybe  not sure  then the software is the best  none  plug it in and windows recognizes it as a disk drive  sees all those  jpg files  and offers to do picture type stuff with them  cool  no third party drivers i believe it loses its clock setting when you replace the batteries  boo hiss  it resets the picture number when you empty it  so you can t get unique file names for all your pictures from the camera it d be nice if it d display the estimated remaining number of pictures on a separate low power lcd like the s10 does  but since media prices have gotten so low i just bought a 64m card and it s usually not an issue one of the most telling endorsements is that when i want to take a quick picture of something around the house  if i see this camera before i see the canon  i ll use it  ,year old third digital camera first two jamcam jr jamcam dare cheese hard use would think kidnap hard use experience kidcams want get low end real camera toy use canon powershot since love new camera quite good need lead display need flash need take decent picture need use replaceable media need relatively cheap camera fill bill nicely first get try fee alkaline bad move brand new alkaline show dead almost instantly read battery characteristics buy night life perfectly acceptable test long live obviously depend much use lead much use flash problem far windows maybe sure software best none plug windows recognize disk drive see pg file offer picture type stuff cool third party drivers believe lose clock set replace batteries hiss rest picture number empty get unique file name picture camera nice display estimate remain number picture separate low power lead like since media price get low buy card usually issue one tell endorsement want take quick picture something around house see camera see canon use
160,auto, before i get into my review of my 1994 chevrolet astro  i feel the need to say that i love this van  in all seriousness  it has probably been the smartest purchase of my life  it has faithfully served myself and my four boys for seven years and over 160 000 miles  and continues to give me everything i ask for in a car with the same quality it did when it rolled off the dealer s lot i purchased the van in late 1994  as a dealer closeout at a rock bottom price  for the premium lt  luxury touring  model on the extended body and all wheel drive  it was mine for about  24 000  a little bit expensive  but when i looked down the street at the dodge grand caravan  a more car like and more stylish model  i found that for a premium trim  comparable equipment  with all wheel drive  the sticker ran well over  30 000  it seemed like a no brainer to me what the smarter deal was  i gave up the more car like temperament of the grand caravan but kept  6000  in my pocket  although it s not as stylish looking as the chrysler built minivans  its strengths lie in other areas  one of these such areas is the powertrain  4 3 liters of high output v 6 engine serve up 200 horsepower and over 250 pound feet of torque  this translates into smooth around town acceleration as well as easy highway merging and two lane passing  the four speed automatic transmission with overdrive is a perfect match for the engine  with it s crisp shifts and an overdrive gear for quiet highway cruising  the fabulous all wheel drive system has never left me stranded in snow  sleet and ice and provides a notable advantage in handling and balance on dry roads the astro is a body on frame van  which means that its bodywork is bolted to a full steel ladder frame  this is good for towing   don t ask me why  but i do know that the astro is rated to pull over 5000 lbs  compare that to a maximum of 3 800 lbs  for chrysler minivans  the exceptionally spacious interior is also well suited to highway cruising  with it s comfortable seats   especially with lt trim  standard seating is two front captain s chairs  power on the driver s side  with adjustable lumbar supports and headrests  my particular van came with second  and third row split folding bench seats that have folding center armrests and outboard headrests  although they are a little on the heavier side  these bench seats are easily removable to open up 170 cubic feet of cargo space the one thing i cannot emphasize enough is the durability of this minivan  160 000 miles later  and with only normal periodic maintenance  it still functions as it did the day i bought it  the body is in perfect condition  i only wash it about twice a month and wax it about twice a year  and the paint still has a glossy shine to it  the interior has taken the abuse my four boys and i have dished out to it in stride   the scotchgard treated cloth seats and carpet resist stains surprisingly well  and the seat cloth shows no wear spots  the suspension has never needed any repairs save for one set of leaf springs  considering the amount of loading and towing i do  this is nothing short of a miracle  and still provides a comfortable ride  the engine starts up with absolutely no hesitation  even on a below zero morning  runs smoothly  quietly and without complaint  and most importantly  has never failed me   something i cannot say about my 1995 voyager   read my review and you ll know what i m talking about however  even i have to admit that this van has it s pitfalls  nothing in life comes without a price  and the price that comes with this van is the lousy gas mileage  i have consistently averaged between 16 and 17 mpg with this vehicle  this is no doubt attributable to the large displacement  for a v 6  truck engine and the all wheel drive system  the control panel also leaves a lot to be desired  the first generation instrument panel of the astro placed climate controls to the immediate right of the gauge cluster  which curiously includes a voltmeter and oil pressure gauge but not a tachometer  and the sound system in the dead center of the dashboard  this is inconvenient for two reasons   1  the front passenger cannot comfortably reach the climate controls  and 2  the driver cannot comfortably reach the sound system  in 1996  chevrolet updated the astro  to include a new dashboard layout which features easy to use rotary climate control knobs and new delco sound systems  the final downfall of this vehicle is the substandard crash test scores  nhtsa rated the 1994 astro as three stars  average  for the driver and one star  very poor  for the front passenger in their front impact test  the insurance institute for highway safety also dealt the astro a sickening blow with its 1996 40 mph offset crash test  which produced extremely poor results  to see the results of this test  visit the following url  http www hwysafety org vehicle ratings ce html 96024 htm  although this test was conducted on a dual airbag equipped astro  the offset crash test is more demanding on the structure of the car rather than the restraint systems  so the results of the 1996 test are largely applicable to earlier models  the lack of a front passenger airbag  a standard feature on grand caravan and town   country  certainly did not help this along at all  a passenger airbag was added in 1996 along with the aforementioned redesigned dashboard  as i have never been in an accident with this van  knocking on wood here  however  i cannot attest to the real world crashworthiness of this vehicle  prospective buyers should note  however  that grand caravan received four stars  enough to earn a  good  rating  for both the driver and front passenger in 1994 regardless of the vehicle s flaws  it has done a commendable job of transporting my family and i see no signs of it ceasing to operate anytime in the near future  when it does  however  i ll be back at my chevy dealer  looking for a new astro  i recently drove my friend s  02 astro lt  and i noticed all the positive attributes of my workhorse as well as some new features i would enjoy  as a final word  i think it goes without saying that this van has certainly lived up to my expectations  and i would certainly recommend it to anyone searching for a functional  spacious  capable minivan  update  1 6 2004   dad  come out and look that was one of my 16 year old twins  pulling into the driveway after work the other day  i went to the front door and he was standing by the astro  with its driver s door open  puzzled  i went over to where he was standing and looked into the vehicle  i didn t notice anything out of the ordinary  i gave him a strange look  and he pointed to the instrument cluster  this time  i took notice  the mechanical odometer indicated that the van had been driven exactly 250 000 miles  wow  it is a small feat that the van has even made it this far  but it is nothing short of a miracle that it has done so with little more than routine maintenance  i still change the oil every 3 000 miles  which happens about once a month  with maxlife synthetic oil  the transmission gets flushed every 25 000  which is about twice a year i would prefer every 12 000  but at  99 a pop  my wallet prefers otherwise  and i add a can of restore at every other oil change  i started using restore at about 185 000 miles  and the car literally feels like new again  my nephew  who is my mechanic of choice  dropped the car off at my house after installing new brakes  practically gushing at how well the van runs  even though the van now serves mostly around town duty  like grocery store runs and my kids driving back and forth to school  i have no doubt that i could hop in and drive across the state  or even across the country  with no problems  this van has certainly earned its place in my garage  long live the astro  ,get review chevrolet gastro feel need say love van seriousness probably smartest purchase

164,camera, i bought this camera in june of 2000 and have used it constantly since then without any problems  i traveled a lot this summer and the small size was convenient  i took photography fall term this year and used this camera and got photo quality results for 8x10 prints with the resolution of the camera  people would pass by and see my picture next to one someone had done in the darkroom and not even realize the difference  i have fooled around with or used most of the features which i ll now go through when the camera is turned on the lens cover opens and the lens comes out  the circular display reads hello  it will then show the battery life and show the mode  amount of pictures left  flash settings  and zoom  the mode can be changed by rotating a circular knob on top  the modes are setup  video  continuous shooting  manual  auto  portrait  landscape  and night photography  auto mode is great for beginners  all they would have to do is zoom in or out and decide whether a flash was necessary the camera has a pop up flash  they can take it with or without the lcd screen  in manual mode the white balance  exposure  flash  and sensitivity can be adjusted  portrait  landscape  and night photography modes are self explanatory  most of the time i usually leave it on manual for portraits or landscapes and it has worked fine but i always kick myself for not have changing the mode  i ve used night photo mode for my night photo assignment and it worked well  since the shutter is open for longer you ll need to use a tripod to make the image sharp  for some of my pictures i purposely moved the camera to create streaks of light and it worked just like a manual camera would have  another plus is the macro lens which also came in handy for one of my assignments  the assignment was nature abstracted and we had to shoot from odd perspectives  with the macro lens i was able to really zoom in on things and see textures  i was really surprised by the video  i ve only used it for videos ranging from 2 15 seconds but they have been pretty sharp and have had surprisingly good sound  playback  playing back pictures is done by flicking a switch  you can go through pictures  play videos  view a slideshow  delete pictures  protect files  and resize image resolution  it s all pretty easy and the slide show has a variety of transitions which i thought was cool  the only con of this camera is using the lcd screen drains the battery much quicker which is pretty much inevitable no matter what camera you buy  the solution  carry extra batteries  it comes with 2 nimh batteries but i recommend buying extra sets  i have a rotation of 3 sets of batteries which works well for my usage  in a bind you can use 2 aa batteries but they won t last very long  another thing is that to my knowledge  fuji doesn t make a carrying case for this camera  i just went to my local photo store and found a case that was a perfect fit made by the brand tamrac  until i found that  i just used a soft cotton drawstring sack from an airline that once held toothpaste etc  i d recommend having a case or some kind of protection  i ve also heard some people complain that the buttons were too small but i personally thought they were fine in conclusion i think this camera was one of the best investments i ve made and i definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera that s compact and or high res under  1000  i hope i covered everything and please feel free to email me about any further questions   ashie3 inorbit com   ,buy camera

165,camera, i recently received the kodak dc215 as an early christmas gift  so i can t complain as a buyer  as i didn t actually pay for it    i know that in atlanta  the going retail rate in the stores is still hovering around  299 for this camera  but the person who purchased it for me found it at of all places  wal mart  at  249  after having used this camera a bit longer  i ve edited my opinion  as seen below  for the good  bad  and misc edited epinion   12 10 00  it s longer  take a deep breath b the good b the kodak dc 215 is in fact  has a very solid feel to it  due to it s metal body  a nice change compared to today s mostly plastic bodies on other digital cameras costing even more  it has a nice feel to it  and a simple   quot square ish quot  body  with a rubber grip on the end for holding comfort  the lcd display is on top of the camera and is easily readable  with four buttons to the right   the larger being the shutter  photo  button  and three smaller buttons to control flash settings  macro  close up  mode  and a self timer  on the back are the color viewer  power  zoom control  settings control  and selection buttons  all are very intuitive  and easy to figure out  even without the manual  the color viewer is slightly recessed  unlike many cameras where it sticks out from the camera body  making it harder to scratch  there is also an optical viewfinder you may use  to conserve batter life  color viewers take a lot of battery power from your camera  which is located up and to the left of the color viewer  nice   you won t leave nose prints on the color view screen  lt g gt a quick note   the documentation for the dc 215 is also excellent  especially for beginners  a clearly and easy to read manual is included  and even my roommate  a techno phobe  could understand it it s nice to find an  optical  zoom on a camera of this price range  instead of a less detailed  digital  zoom  still  if you re new to digital cameras  you should note that a 2x optical zoom is only equal to a slightly closer than  quot real vision view quot  in other words  2x is not technically a  quot zoom quot    3x and above are truly  quot zooms quot  that get you noticeably closer to the object s  to be photographed than your normal vision would see  still  again  a 2x optical is nice for this price range photo quality is a mixed bag  depending on the environment  i ve found that indoor photos with the flash and without  during day hours with natural sunlight in the rooms  turn out pretty nice overall  the flash does tend to flatten out colors slightly  but not enough to make the photos turn out horrible  for the most part  colors are rich and detail is pretty good  the various quality settings  talked about below more  allow you to adjust the camera for better quality indoor photos as well  with a greater range of quality settings than found on some other cameras b the bad b outdoor photos are somewhat more of a disappointment with the dc 215  outside  photos are fine when your subject is within 12 15 feet of you  however  the dc 215 s fixed focus lens is not able to capture great details on distant objects  such as landscapes  mountains  trees  etc  only an auto focus lens found on other camera  usually costing more  will provide that detail  in other words  the dc 215 is great for casual photos of the pets  kids  or get togethers  but i might not pick it for those cherished scenic shops of your vacation in europe  if you re lucky enough to get  quot paint shop pro 7 quot  then you ll find that you can increase the image quality of many of your photos  however my largest disappointment with the dc 215 is the very flimsy door that you flip open in order to retrieve the compact flash storage card  i feel this is going to be the first part of the camera to break for many folks  especially if you re a guy with big fingers    the small button you must swivel up and push in  in order to eject the flash card  is equally frail  i ll take points off for these two features   kodak should have done a better quality job on these parts b misc b the standard silver dc 215 edition camera comes with a 4 meg compact flash card  this may or may not allow you to store a lot of photos  depending on your settings  so  you may wish to invest in another larger storage card  for example  if you wish to print your photos  then you ll want to set your camera for  quot best quot  resolution  1154 x 864 pixel size  and  quot best quot  quality  which will then only allow you to save about 13 photos  if however  you re only going to email your photos  you may be able to set the camera for  quot standard quot  resolution  640 x 480 pixel size  and  quot good quot  quality  which then allows you to save up to around 59 photos  the higher the quality setting  the less  quot jaggies quot  and blurred  quot artifact quot  object you ll see in your photos  but the less photos you can store on the card  i settled for a standard physical size of 640x480  and  best  quality  which is the clearest quality setting  so i get approximately 28 photos per 4 meg card  sounds confusing  but you ll get the hang of it soon enough   the manual is very clearly written to help you understand if you re a heavy photo taker  invest as many will say here  in rechargeable batteries  i recently purchased a set of 4 nickel metal hydride  maxell  brand batteries at circuit city with the charger  for under  30  and they work well with this camera  and add to the amount of time you can use it   rating and sample photos  i ll give this camera a good rating for the casual photo taker  ebayers  real estate and insurance folks  and those who like to make small casual print  as well as those who like to email pics of the kids and pets to the grand folks  as i said before  if you re wanting a camera to take 5 star quality scenic or vacation photos   i d look for one of the olympus brands  like the 460  490  or 3030 model numbers  for that kind of quality  the dc 215 is worth the investment for it s ease of use  and adequate photo quality for the price if you d like to see some sample pics i ve taken with the dc 215

166,camera, i just bought this camera a week ago  and the early returns on it are good  kodak had a nice quick start guide poster that gets you going immediately  took me about 20 minutes to take some pictures and transfer them to my pc  that s including going through some of the basic menu function settings  like deleting shots  using the 2x zoom the colors are truly something  vibrant and clear this is a great starter camera  my main use is for e mails and storing photos on my hard drive  i thought of going the more expensive route  but after reading favorable reviews for this camera i was sold  i paid  170  plus there s a  30 rebate  under  150 is a steal  why pay over  300 for 2 3 megapixel cameras now  if and when i decide to upgrade in a year or so the prices of the higher pixel cameras will probably be under  300 yes  the 2 mb of internal memory is low  and there is no usb support  that can be remedied w  the picture card reader  30  and flash card memory   40 50 for 32 mb  no lens cap included but one can be obtained free from kodak upon request  which i did when i registered the camera at their website  if you re looking for a camera for e mail and personal use this is more than adequate  besides  for e mail it s really better to send photos with a lower pixel count  2 megapixels or more is overkill another small feature i like is that it uses aa batteries  which in the long run can be much cheaper than specific camera batteries  you can use regular alkaline or the new nickel metal halide rechargeables  ,buy camera week ago early return good today nice quick start guide poster get go immediately take minutes take picture transfer pp include go basic menu function settings like meet shots use room color truly something vagrant clear great start camera main use mail store photo hard drive think go expensive route read favorable review camera sell pay plus debate steal pay megapixel camera decide upgrade year price higher fix camera probably yes mb internal memory low us support remedied picture card reader flash card memory mb lens cap include one obtain free today upon request register camera webster look camera mail personal use adequate besides mail really better send photo lower fix count megapixels overall another small feature like use batteries long run much cheaper specific camera batteries use regular alkaline new nickel metal aside rechargeables
167,auto, americans travelling in europe for the first time often have a moment of culture shock when they hail a taxi and a mercedes e class or bmw 5 series pulls up to the curb  in america  these cars have been icons of intelligence and success for more than a generation  in their homeland they are more likely to be diesel powered taxis designed for durability and low operating cost than ultimate driving machines bred for the autobahn in the late 80 s ford tried to beat the germans at their own game  in 1986 they had bet the company on the groundbreaking taurus  if you weren t there  it is almost impossible to imagine the impact this car had on the american auto industry  its styling was as cutting edge as any european sedan of the time and it had much more of a european feel than any american sedan made before  it couldn t compete against the european sedans sold here  but ford wondered if the germans could remake a taxi into a world class sport sedan  could they do it with a car that had won the hearts of conservative middle america that was the challenge that faced the taurus sho throughout its eleven year production run  it was by any objective standard a worthy competitor to the midsize entries from bmw and mercedes  one with a distinctive american accent  but in the end not enough buyers could make the mental leap that this taurus was different than the one their parents had traded in their fairmont or caprice classic for b overview and driving impressions b there were three generations of the sho  the first  1989 1991  was the original  86  quot jellybean quot  taurus platform with the sho v 6 and suspension component upgrades  the final version  1996 1999  used the all new  quot oval quot  taurus platform and carried an equally new v 8  but i don t recommend either  the first generation sho was a great engine mated to a chassis that wasn t intended for it  while the third became so refined it lost much of the distinctive personality in the earlier versions  the sweet spot was the 1992 1995 second generation cars  in 1992 all taurii were redesigned and the sho received distinctive front and rear styling that gave it a crisper  stronger look than the first edition  under the skin several weaknesses and customer complaints had been addressed  and the entire platform was strengthened  giving the sho handling abilities that came closer to matching the germans than any american sedan that came before  and in 1993 it finally got the automatic transmission the pundits said it needed to win over american buyers the heart of the sho was its engine  yamaha was originally hired to design a new cylinder head for the 3 0 liter ford v 6  the head they came up with produced too much power for the ford block to live with  so ford contracted them to come up with an entire powerplant  their answer was a dual overhead cam  24 valve v 6 that only shared a three liter displacement with the engine in lesser taurus models  the engine was a marvel  with 220 horsepower available the sho was the most powerful engine in its class by a slim marging  but it weighed 400 pounds less than the merc and 500 pounds less than the bmw  this made the taurus sho the quickest car in its class more important than the numbers was how different the three cars felt in action  the mercedes  from its engine to how the ashtray door closed with a solid but velvet smooth action  felt literally like a bank vault on wheels  the bmw reeked of refinement by drivers  extremely capable yet never feeling like it would lose its composure  both were outstanding cars with clear personalities  but neither  in my book  compared to the shot of tequila and a big slap on the back feeling of the sho  when you got into the gas in the ford the engine growled  the steering wheel tugged slightly in your hands  then the growl became a roar as the tachometer needle swung quickly towards 7 000 rpm  it wasn t crude  in capable hands the sho was a remarkably composed car to drive at speed with little body roll and crisp responses  the sho was simply spicier and more engaging than the germans one of the big reasons to choose a second generation car over a first is the shifter mechanism for the five speed transaxle  first gen sho s used a cable actuated shifter that had all the feel of stirring a pot of warm molasses  starting in  92 all five speed sho s ditched the spaghetti wires for solid linkage that greatly improved the feel  but it was still notably less precise than the action on the rear wheel drive bmw with its superb five speed  all front wheel drive cars share this handicap compared to a good rear wheel drive setup  torque steer  another bane of powerful front wheel drive cars  could tug the wheel in your hands but you really had to be hamfisted with the throttle to have it effect your driving  as i mentioned earlier  in 1993 the sho got the slushbox  automatic  the critics said the market wanted  the thinking was  as only a relative few bmw s came to america with manual gearboxes and mercedes didn t offer them on any model in the e class  to compete the sho needed an automatic even if the purists had a fit over it  the critics were half right  the automatic didn t make the sho a bestseller but it did improve the feel of driving the car  this is just my personal preference  but in a midsized or larger sedan i prefer an automatic if it is done right  hustling a small light sports car up a road and snapping through shifts is one of life s greater joys  but a 3 000 pound sedan is more enjoyable when the strategy is smoothness and forethought  and a good automatic is better partnered to this style of driving  in the sho it was no contest in my book  the automatic was a better automatic than the manual was manual  huh  while the manual was improved in  92  it still had an imprecision that hindered finding a gear instinctively  the automatic was better mated to the sho  with crisp  smooth upshifts that matched the sporting personality of the car  and the effect of torque steer was greatly reduced compared to the manual  unless you are the kind of enthusiast who can t have any sports car with an automatic  the auto is a better way to go if the taurus was a bargain bmw  as reviewers and fans called it  it hid the trimmed corners well  i don t know how ford made a dime on them  i prepped new cars and did trim nvh repairs at a large ford dealer in 92 94 and quickly noticed that a loaded out taurus lx was only a couple of thousand dollars less than a sho  fully equipped  with leather  excellent power sport seats  full power accessories  power glass moonroof  premium  jbl  sound  cd and the automatic the sticker came in at less than  25 000  the e 320 and 530i weighed in at almost twice that fifty large in the same trim  it s the greatest price disparity between similar cars that i ve ever seen b reliability and maintenance b against all bets when it was in production  the second generation sho has proven itself a remarkably durable car  only three big dollar problem areas have been uncovered on the second generation cars  sho s driven in the snowbelt during winter have been known to develop corrosion in the engine subframe  it s not a fatal problem  the subframe can be replaced for a few hundred dollars  including labor  the front brakes are another consistent source of trouble  the second generation cars were slightly better but ford simply put rotors on the car that were too small to stand up to the punishment of a high performance sports sedan  the rotors get too hot and warp when used hard  and like most cars made in the last decade ford only included enough metal on the them to have them machined and trued once   maybe  if you were lucky and caught it soon enough  finally  for all the initial concern about funneling 200 lb ft of torque through a front wheel drive transaxle  the only weak link has been the clutch in the manual transmission models  the brake and clutch problems can be cured with the right application of high performance parts  and the engine subframe is a job that should be good for several years  all in all  not a bad list of  quot major quot  problem areas for a high performance car   and by contrast  the second generation base taurus models have earned a lemon reputation for blowing head gaskets in their 3 8 liter engines and eating their axod e transaxles the sho models shared no engine parts with the base models and used specially modified transmissions that have proven very durable  can anyone think of another high performance engine transmission that is more reliable than the base model one problem area that isn t unique to the sho but needs to be mentioned is the importance of keeping the thermostat and catalytic converters in good condition  if the thermostat sticks open the engine won t overheat  but something just as bad can happen  all fuel injected engines use the engine temperature as one of the major factors to determine the air fuel mixture  if the engine is running too cold  as it will when the thermostat is stuck open  the mixture will be too rich  but instead of this unburned fuel vapor pouring out the tailpipe and creating smog  it is ignited and burned in the cat  which gets much hotter than it was designed to be and begins to break apart inside  it s not a problem until you lift off the gas from a higher engine speed  like when getting off the freeway  when you do this the airflow through the engine reverses momentarily and because the cats on the sho are mounted close to the engine if there is any debris in the cat it can be sucked back into the engine  it is just a destructive as pouring metal shavings in the intake  all four areas should be checked out before buying a sho  the yamaha engine has proven to be as tough as granite  aside from possible valve guide wear in hard driven cars there haven t been any major problems with the engine at all   look for a little blue smoke at a cold startup  hard starting  or oil consumption greater than a quart every 700 miles  like most of their motorcycle engines  the sho does not have hydraulic valve adjustors so the clearance has to be set by a mechanic  but unlike a bike it s not a regular occurrence  ford specifies a major service between 60 000 and 100 000 miles that includes a valve adjustment and replacing the engine timing belt  spark plug wires and control arm bushings  it is a major bill  but nothing compared to the expense of failure if something like the timing belt lets go  and this service on the sho will cost a fraction of the same service expenses on a bmw or mercedes as the miles reach this territory   one note  the sho  like any vehicle with an all aluminium engine  should have the coolant system flushed and replaced every year other problems fall into the nitpick category  in looking through the newsgroup boards  i was pleasantly surprised to see that most of the problems owners are reporting after five years are the same ones i saw when the cars were still under warranty  most involving interior trim parts  is my relief confusing  while the lumbar support leaking and the wiper control on the turn signal stalk failing too soon is evidence that there were some areas where ford missed the mark in design and manufacture  after five to seven years i expected to see new problems emerging as the cars piled up the miles and that hasn t been the case  the good news is  the owner groups have developed inexpensive solutions for all the interior problems if you have a little mechanical ability with one exception  if you notice the driver seat rocks when you sit down or move the only fix is replacing the power mechanism  a bracket with the adjustor motors and trays that move the seat  it s not a safety hazard the seat is still firmly attached to the floor  but if you want to repair it plan on laying out about  300 for a new power mechanism   pricing and owner support b the discovery of the enthusiast and aftermarket support on the web for the sho has been another pleasant surprise  there are regional sho owner clubs across america and a strong aftermarket for replacement and high performance parts   note to gearheads  the level of aftermarket support for the v 6 sho is as good as you ll find for a camaro or mustang  at extremely affordable prices for this class  too  along with continued parts support from ford  the sho is one of the rare limited edition models that hasn t become an orphan in retirement  but it does remain one of the best values in the entire automotive market  the kelly blue book quotes a  10 200 retail price for a  95 sho automatic with 75 000 miles in my area  like when it was new that is almost exactly half the blue book for a 530i or e 320  but in my area that would buy you an immaculate car  in the last year i ve seen close to a dozen very clean 92 95 sho s with prices in the  7 000 range  and because most sho buyers weren t testosterone poisoned young adults  read camaro mustang market  the chances of finding a well maintained and cared for car are very good b conclusion b a sho has been on my list of cars to have since i worked on them at earnhardt ford  it s a terrific sports sedan at an econobox price that has held up remarkably well  and the mad scientist in me still gets an evil grin when i think about the things i wanted to do with it   and that was when i only imagine stripping all the power amenities and losing a quick 60 70 pounds just on the interior  now i can get superchargers that make up to  400 horsepower i  bottom line  as an entertaining and unique sport sedan to be appreciated for what ford created  or as the platform for a midlife crisis  the sho is impossible to beat  it was one of the most easily overlooked cars when it was new  and today it has become a hidden treasure for enthusiasts  and if a bimmer owner scoffs  as they are wont to do  just ask how he likes his taxi    brian igo  i the source for everything you ever wanted to know about the sho  and one of the best auto fan sites i ve seen on the web  is  shotimes com   this is an indispensable resource for sho owners  all of the diy cheap fixes i mentioned in passing are there  along with an excellent reference on troubleshooting literally dozens of different conditions and

169,auto, wow  i am so far very impressed with this vehicle  while it only has about 900 miles on it now it has proven itself to be quite capable in any situation i have encountered with it  it is the two door  two wheel drive version  which is the lightest  it has what i consider excellent acceleration for an suv leaving behind my father s 1994 f150 and my mothers 1999 suburban easily  in some informal stoplight races it has held its own against those annoying honda civics with the exhausts  body kits and ugly graphics all over them  it has proven to be easy to drive in wet conditions easily as well and the four wheel antilock disc brakes do a wonderful job of stopping you  even if you fishtail in this truck  it is easy to bring back under control  it does not exhibit very much body roll when going through turns  in large part due to the huge sway bar under the front end  it looks like its about two inches around and it does its job very well  the suspension is very tight for a truck  it rides a little bumpy but because of this  it handles very well  it even has bilstein shocks in the back  i originally wanted a leather interior but much to my dissapointment it only comes with cloth in the two door models  however after living with the cloth for a couple of weeks i have decided that it is more comfortable  my mom has leather in her suburban and it isnt as comfortable as my cloth is  the seats are firmer and have less side bolstering if you have the leather seats  i got every option that you could get except for a towing package and this makes it a very nice ride  the audio system is very good for a factory system and comes complete with 6 speakers  i also have the steering wheel mounted audio controls  when i got them i didnt think i would ever use them but now i find that i rarely touch the stereo in the dash other than to change cd s  i have the overhead console that tells such things as average speed  mpg  instant mpg  range  amount of gas used etc  this is rather interesting but i usually only use it to find out the temperature and my average mpg  speaking of mpg  this thing drinks gas  my previous car was a toyota camry and i was used to getting at the worst around 18 mpg and that was with my foot to the floor constantly  now  if i drive ultra conservatively i might be able to get 17 mpg in the city  usually it is more like 15 in the city and 21 on the highway though  while the engine drinks gas  it does put it to good use  put your foot to the floor and you are rewarded with v8 like acceleration  while i do have the lightest model they make and that helps  this engine makes a lot of torque and decent horsepower and is more than adequate for any driving situation  however  if you look at the size of the engine i think there is quite a bit of power left in it and i plan on upgrading to k n cold air induction  freer flowing exhaust and a jet chips control module to pick up some more power  one of the coolest features of this truck is the ability for everything to fold flat from the tailgate to the front seats  you just lift one handle and shove and the back seats both fold flat with the headrest automatically flipping themselves up  it is rather nice and allows you to easily haul large objects  the tow rating of the truck is 5700 lbs  and this is more than adequate for most things including our family boat  i havent towed anything with it yet i didnt get the optional frame mounted hitch but i know it would do a good job  finally  my favorite features of the car are the excellent four wheel disc brakes with antilock on all 4 wheels  these things stop you quick  and the floor mounted gear selector  i am used to driving a car so it made it very easy for me to transition and i like it better than a column mounted shifter anyway  in short  i think anyone looking for an suv that can fit into small spaces easily  isnt very large but has adequate room inside  with plenty of power to spare should purchase a blazer  i m glad i did  ,far impress vehicle miles prove quite capable situation encounter two door two wheel drive version lightest consider excellent acceleration sun leave behind father mother suburban easily informal starlight race hold annoy hand civics exhaust body kit ugly graphics prove easy drive wet condition easily well four wheel antilock disc rake wonderful job stop even

170,auto, i ve had my avalanche for 7 months now  the more i drive it  the less likely i am to drive anything else  i have the z66  with 2 wheel drive and the 5 7 liter v8  it came with a one year subscription to onstar  leather seats  heavy duty floor mats  am fm cd player  amazing electric seats  with heaters built in  computerized controls for everything  including oil change intervals i love the appearance of my truck  there s never a shortage of people who want a ride in it  it rides like a cloud down the highway  there are storage compartments on each side of the truck bed with plenty of room for average people  although these probably are not suitable for contractors  the bed covers do keep the bed dry and the bed liner has anti skid characteristics that do keep things from sliding around back there  i have even had a couple of occasions to take mine off road and it handled very well   even though it only has two wheel drive the interior is comfortable and roomy  it will carry 5 adults comfortably  it also has enough storage that i carry way too much stuff around with me i was concerned about reliability and ordered the 70 000 mile warranty  so far  at 26 000 miles  i ve not had any occasion to use the warranty a word about onstar  i bought my truck new and the onstar feature  which requires a subscription  came with one year for free  i understand that there are various levels of service you can get  i will renew my basic subscription  i ve locked my keys in the truck twice and onstar was able to unlock the truck in both instances within 5 minutes with only a short phone call  this feature has a panic button that will automatically dispatch emergency services if you ever need it  and onstar can track the location of your vehicle if it s stolen i never thought i d own a vehicle with all the features this one has  i absolutely love mine i will share a few of the things that i wish were different  please don t misconstrue this short list   the benefits of this vehicle far outweigh these minor obstacles first  while the bed covers do keep things dry and add to the overall appearance of the vehicle   they are inconvenient to remove and store  there s a big canvas bag that you can store them in  but when in storage they take up a fair amount of space in the bed  assuming you took them off to carry something in the bed  you ll be a little disappointed in the amount of room back there second  this vehicle does not have a lot of excess power  i have found it adequate in all ways  but you can t punch it and get the same acceleration you ll find on lighter trucks overall  i am a very satisfied driver of a 2002 chevy avalanche  if you re looking for a feature laden  very comfortable vehicle with class and style  i highly recommend it  ,avalanche months drive less likely drive anything else wheel drive later come one year subscription star leather seat heavy duty floor mat player amaze electric seat theaters build computerize control everything include oil change intervals love appearance truck never shortage people want ride rid like cloud highway storage compartments side truck bed plenty room average people although probably suitable contractors bed cover keep bed dry bed line anti say characteristics keep things slide around back even couple occasion take mine road handle well even though two wheel drive interior comfortable room carry adults comfortably also enough storage carry way much stuff around concern reliability order mile warranty far miles occasion use warranty word star buy truck new star feature require subscription come one year free understand various level service get renew basic subscription lock key truck twice star able clock truck instance within minutes short phone call feature panic button automatically dispatch emergency service ever need star track location vehicle steal never think vehicle feature one absolutely love mine share things wish different please misconstrue short list benefit vehicle far outweigh minor obstacles first bed cover keep things dry add overall appearance vehicle inconvenient remove store big canvas bag store storage take fair amount space bed assume take carry something bed little disappoint amount room back second vehicle lot excess power find adequate ways punch get acceleration find lighter trunks overall satisfy driver avalanche look feature lade comfortable vehicle class style highly recommend
171,camera, the minolta dimage 7 is so far the best camera i have ever used  having a minolta 35mm camera in the past  this was very easy to get used to  there are two sides to the camera  beginner and professional  one side is the camera has automatic exposure and presets for certain events  i e  sunsets and sporting events  which helps if you are new to photography  the other is filled with rich features  such as shutter speed  white balance  and color balance  the camera also has 3 types of flash modes  standard flash  red eye reduction  and rear flash sync the resolution has to be the best thing about the camera  it has an astounding resolution of 2560 x 1920 at its maximum image size  along with the resolution you can control the image quality  here are the modes of compression for the image quality  all file sizes are for the resolution 2560 x 1920  raw mode  has to be downloaded through the camera for decoding  this mode gives you the best quality at 9 5mb per picture on the card before decoding  raw is only saved as a tiff after it has been decoded  next is super fine mode  which can be saved at 14 1mb per photo  this is saved in a jpg image format  fine mode  can be saved at 2 1mb per picture  this too is saved as a jpg  standard mode can be saved at 1 1mb per picture and this too is saved in a jpg format  last  economy mode  which can be saved at 0 65mb per image and is saved in a jpg format  since when you buy the camera they give you a 16mb compact flash card  i would recommend putting the images at 2560 x 1920 and standard mode for the compression  i have a 256mb compact card which i bought additionally  can hold about 227 images at 2560 x 1920 with standard mode compression  why don t i use a better image quality since i have a big card you may ask  i do not see a difference in the photos  with fine mode and a resolution of 2560 x 1920 i only got 125 images to the 256mb card  i compared photographs taken of the same object at different image qualities and they looked the same  if you really think about it  you re only going to reduce the image anyway when you send it in an email or put it up on a website  as you reduce the image on the computer from the original 2560 x 1920  you will see it will get sharper  printing from the original image size you will see amazing results  you figure every 100 pixels equals 1 inch  so the original image if you brought it to a print shop  while maintaining the same image quality with out enlarging it would be around 25  x 19 the battery life is okay  on 4 alkaline batteries it lasts about 5 pictures  with the ni mh batteries  which the camera recommends  can last anywhere from 10 photos to 50 photos  depending on how much you use the zoom  focus and macro mode the minolta dimage 7 has to be the best camera i have ever owned  it has a beginner s side and a professional s wanting  i would highly recommend this camera who is getting started in photography and any professional that wants a inexpensive camera that is loaded with features  ,minorca damage far best camera ever use minorca mm camera past easy get use two side camera beginner professional one side camera automatic exposure present certain events sunset sport events help new photography fill rich feature shutter speed white balance color balance camera also type flash modes standard flash red eye reduction rear flash son resolution best thing camera astound resolution maximum image size along resolution control image quality modes compression image quality file size resolution raw mode download camera decide mode give best quality mb per picture card decide raw save stiff decide next super fine mode save mb per photo save pg image format fine mode save mb per picture save pg standard mode save mb per picture save pg format last economy mode save mb per image save pg format since buy camera give mb compact flash card would recommend put image standard mode compression mb compact card buy additional hold image standard mode compression use better image quality since big card may ask see difference photo fine mode resolution get image mb card compare photograph take object different image qualities look really think go reduce image anyway send email put webster reduce image computer original see get sharper print original image size see amaze result figure every pip equal inch original image bring print shop maintain image quality enlarge would around battery life okay alkaline batteries last picture ni batteries camera recommend last anywhere photo photo depend much use room focus micro mode minorca damage best camera ever own beginner side professional want would highly recommend camera get start photography professional want expensive camera load feature
172,camera, i recently decided to get involved in the digital photography arena and believe me going into this i had no idea what to look for  thanks to epinions and the internet itself  i was able to do what i believe to be thorough research  my search for the perfect camera to suit my families needs actually began when i decided i need a better over all printer  that is another story in itself  but i will tell you i ended up purchasing the hp photosmart 1218 which is the perfect printer for this camera well  back to this review  after making my decision on the printer  it was time to decide what camera to purchase  now hp has a line of cameras made specifically for its  photosmart printer but some flags came up in doing my homework on their hp c500  it seems that the reviews i read on it were not favorable at all  yes  it did have the hp infrared jet scan feature that allows you to send your photos directly to the printer without taking the card out of the camera  it works much like a remote control does with a tv  but the over all quality of the camera was rated very low for the cost  now i am a big hp person and i know they stand for quality  but i was not to sure a to their history with camera so i decided to go to the field and see for myself  much to my surprise  no one locally carried that camera  only the c200 which is quite a step down  that when i came upon the d 490 zoom  my wife and i played with it alittle at the store and immediately we knew we had to give this camera serious consideration  it had a nice outer look to it  it had both your optical view finder and the basic 1 8 lcd monitor  that also allows you to zoom in on playback mode which sold my wife  the sliding lens cover was a nice benefit although it takes some getting use to  but you can t lose it  the menu is very easy to follow after looking over the enclosed manual  best thing of all is i just take my smartmedia card out of the camera and pop it right into the built in card reader in my hp photosmart 1218 and whalla i ve got photos i never knew it would be so easy  my family and i like to travel  my wife is always asking about taking family portraits  relatives are wanting pictures from time to time and i am very much involved in different activities  now i can take as many photos whenever and wherever i want  i purchased both an additional 16 mb and 32 mb smartmedia card along rechargeable battery kit  we are set to meet our needs for some years now     ,recently decide get involve digital photography arena believe go idea look thank opinions internet able believe thorough research search perfect camera suit families need actually begin decide need better printer another story tell end purchase photosmart perfect printer camera well back review make decision printer time decide camera purchase line camera make specifically photosmart printer flag come homework seem review read favorable yes inflame jet scan feature allow send photo directly printer without take card camera work much like remote control quality camera rate low cost big person know stand quality sure history camera decide go field see much surprise one locally carry camera quite step come upon room wife play little store immediately know give camera serious consideration nice outer look optical view finder basic lead monitor also allow room playback mode sell wife slide lens cover nice benefit although take get use lose menu easy follow look enclose manual best thing take smartmedia card camera pop right build card reader photosmart shall get photo never know would easy family like travel wife always ask take family portraits relatives want picture time time much involve different activities take many photo whenever wherever want purchase additional mb mb smartmedia card along rechargeable battery kit set meet need years

174,camera, this is a great camera  it s easy to use and comes with a great manual and technical support  i called the good folks at canon for what later turned out to be a misunderstanding on my part  and they were readily available and surprisingly helpful the a20 is designed to be easy to use since it automatically determines shutter speed and exposure  the a20 also uses a 3 pt  auto focus system that helps reduce fuzzy faces from photos  a problem i had often experienced with my previous digital camera the camera is versatile  you are never short on power since it s able to utilize the aa size alkaline batteries that are available worldwide  the power shot can also capture up to 500 images using alkaline batteries or up to 1000 images with nimh batteries  i  like others  found that the aa batteries died out very quickly  this is a negative thing  but the added convenience of a dual power source makes up for it  if you don t have to  you can avoid using aa s until an emergency crops up another great thing in this camera is the flash  it is excellent  and i read that it provides the highest light output in its class  it s believable despite an affordable price tag  the camera provides several features normally associated with more expensive models  such as shutter speeds from 1 second to 1 1500 of a second  high precision white balance  and nine image quality modes that help users to choose the perfect level of definition you can store up to 87 images in this camera with the supplied 8mb mem card and then use the usb interface to connect the camera to your macintosh or pc computer and upload them  the software that was bundled with my a20 included zoombrowser ex 2 6  imagebrowser 1 6 for mac users  and photostitch 3 1 this is quite simply a great camera  i work at a circuit city  so i know what the competition holds  for the price and the features  you can t go wrong  ,great camera easy use come great manual technical support call good folks canon later turn misunderstand part readily available surprisingly helpful design easy use since automatically determine shutter speed exposure also use auto focus system help reduce fully face photo problem often experience previous digital camera camera versatile never short power since able utilize size alkaline batteries available worldwide power shoot also capture image use alkaline batteries image nigh batteries like others find batteries die quickly negative thing add convenience dual power source make avoid use emergency crop another great thing camera flash excellent read provide highest light output class believable despite unfordable price tag camera provide several feature normally associate expensive model shutter speed second second high precision white balance nine image quality modes help users choose perfect level definition store image camera supply mb card use us interface connect camera mackintosh pp computer unload software bundle include zoombrowser ex imagebrowser mac users photostitch quite simply great camera work circuit city know competition hold price feature go wrong

176,camera,  not recommended for any user  the pdc 640 is a very basic digital camera that is easily surpassed by just about every other camera out there i i received this camera as a gift for christmas and began to use it fairly regularly afterwards  i had returned it on february 11th because of problems with the lcd display and the fact that you couldn t see the picture anymore   picture quality  the picture quality  640x480   no megapixel rating given  on the camera is good enough for web pages and e mail  but does not produce quality prints  for anyone looking for a camera to print pictures from  this is not your camera b camera use  i found the use of the lcd display on the camera awkward and clunky  there were no easy ways to get the images to load up on the display  no on off switch  the images would often flicker and the display would often turn itself off while you were trying to navigate the menus  within a month of fairly active use  the lcd display image began to degrade and breakup  i returned the camera because i was unable to see the images on the lcd display  they would be full of lines and would be all garbled on the display  in addition the lack of an auto focus was a major drawback to this camera  many of my pictures were blurred beyond use because of the need to select one of three different modes  close up  intermediate  distance  while the image quality was good when the right mode was selected  more often than not i did not think about the mode before i took the picture and later realized that i had been in the wrong mode  in those cases  most of the pictures were lost b final thoughts  i would only recommend this camera for a person who is going to use the images for either the web or in e mail  the print quality is not high enough to created quality printed images  however  the awkward controls on the lcd display and the need to choose distance modes would make me wonder if i should recommend this to anyone  if i you were thinking about buying it  i would take it out of the box and try it for yourself b photography reviews b i books and magazines i a href content 95587765892 shutterbug magazine a     a href content 94737174148 popular photography magazine a     a href content 109519933060 pc photo a     a href content 118512717444 outdoor photography a     a href content 120329637508 photography outdoors a     a href content 128619810436 american photo a i cameras i a href content 102769987204 olympus c 4000 digital camera a     a href content 14022446724 olympus d 460 zoom digital camera a     a href content 9245200004 minolta maxxum 300si  35mm slr a     a href content 8987512452 polaroid pdc 640 digital camera a     a href content 121532681860 kodak easyshare cx4300 digital camera a     a href content 121751637636 canon elph lt aps camera a     a href content 122034556548 olympus stylus infinity zoom 35mm camera a i printers  scanners   memory  a href content 107691740804 sandisk 128mb smartmedia card a     a href content 118524972676 memorex 128mb smartmedia card a     a href content 119150120580 hp photosmart 1115 a     a href content 119374974596 microtek scanmaker 4800 a     a href content 123388464772 hp scanjet 3570c a  ,recommend user basic digital camera easily surpass every camera receive camera gift christmas begin use fairly regularly afterwards return february th problems lead display fact see picture anymore picture quality picture quality megapixel rat give camera good enough web page mail produce quality print anyone look camera print picture camera use find use lead display camera awkward cling easy ways get image load display switch image would often flick display would often turn try navigable venus within month fairly active use lead display image begin degrade breakup return camera unable see image lead display would full line would marble display addition lack auto focus major drawback camera many picture blur beyond use need select one three different modes close intermediate distance image quality good right mode select often think mode take picture later realize wrong mode case picture lose final thoughts would recommend camera person go use image either web mail print quality high enough create quality print image however awkward control lead display need choose distance modes would make wonder recommend anyone think buy would take box try photography review book magazines content shutterbug magazine content popular photography magazine content pp photo content outdoor photography content photography outdoor content american photo camera content polypus digital camera content polypus room digital camera content minorca maximum si mm sir content polaroid digital camera content today easyshare c digital camera content canon camera content polypus status infinity room mm camera printers manners memory content sand mb smartmedia card content memory mb smartmedia card content photosmart content microbes scanmaker content scarlet
177,auto, introduction so what the heck is this thing  thats what i wondered  i ve never heard of diatsu  dhiatsue  or yeah  daihatsu  that is  until a friend of a friend got one  this is pretty close to  if not  the first mini suv  its well worth its weight in yen so what they heck is it surprisingly enough  it was imported from japan by cadillac  the rocky was made from 1990 to 1993  it has dual overhead cams dohc  in a small four cylinder engine  we have never been able to determine the size  it is fairly small  sadly  daihatsu has either pulled out of the united states market or they went out of business  i m hoping for the first pro s well  lets see  this thing is a very nice little suv first of all  with the little engine  you can expect well over 30 mpg  probably closer to 35  once while four wheeling it  we went well below empty sweating  we were  for an estimated total of 500 miles on the gas tank which holds 15 gallons the four wheel drive worked very well  this thing would go anywhere my blazer would go  and then some this thing was after the heart of the slk kompressor lovers  with a removable hardtop in the rear  and a flip up sunroof in the front we don t know the exact mileage  since the speedometer and the odometer haven t worked since they aquired the vehicle in 1995  they have made four round trips to chicago from the grand canyon  and it is a daily driver of at least 20 miles a day  sometimes as much as 200 miles a day twice a month  my estimate is that this vehicle easily has 200 000 miles on it  with nothing mechanically wrong  the spark plugs are very easy to change  with the right wrench  and everything else mechanically speaking is easy to do even with a not so great 16 year old driver  abusing it daily  this thing is holding up great  i don t know who made the engine  if it was daihatsu or if they bought premanufactured engines  i d guess that honda built the engine since it has been so reliable neutral with the sunroof up on bumpy roads  it rattles  a lot  on smooth roads it is pretty quiet this thing easily seats four people  there isn t much more room than that  but for a compact suv  what do you expect  there is very little room behind the rear seat the spare tire somewhat hinders backing view  but nothing to worry about  and not nearly as bad as jeep wranglers or  who the heck makes this  amigo s since i think this was daihatsu first attempt at four wheel drive  manual hubs are excused  they still suck  and i ve had to get out one too many times in the mud to lock them cons with a little four banger  do you expect power  i don t  and you certainly don t get it  0 60 as tested in a race against my blazer is just under 22 seconds  being the boring town of grand canyon  we have little to do but mess with our cars  we even know the 1 4 mile time  21 5 second at 66 mph  for those of you who don t know what this means  between 17 and 19 seconds is average for most family cars  a corvette will do the quarter mile in 13 3 seconds never fear  this thing will hold freeway speeds  and highways speeds  just don t try to go up steep inclines at the speed limit don t expect to tow anything  at least in my blazer the v6 puts out quite a bit more torque than horsepower 210 torque to 173 hp  in this  thats not the case  my guess is about 100 horsepower  and 100 ft  lbs  of torque  it can barely pull around four average males  let alone any size trailer overall this little suv is ideal for college students that want a little bit of attitude to their geo  it will go anywhere  muddy or not  and we have never felt that we compromised our safety while  quot romping quot  it if you don t mind being slow  but getting great gas mileage  this is for you  the reliability is great  the comfort is too  just don t plan on hauling all of your friends and all of their stuff around br br  ,introduction neck thing wonder never hear diatsu dhiatsue yeah daihatsu friend friend get one pretty close first mind sun well

178,auto, can someone please explain to me what in forsaken name is wrong with american cars  am i so periodically pulled to these vehicles only on the grounds that i was born in this country  i honestly can say as an american that i have found enough grave reservations to diagnose a pontiac grand am  any year  with an  identity crisis  how confident did i feel as a young  avid student when i first purchased my 1995 seii pontiac   consisted of  seii sports package v6  3 1l engine 16  wheels  slightly better suspension roof rack splash guards automatic everything almost gt version it is only now that i have given myself the benefit of the doubt that this really is a bad car  i purchased it used from a woman that swore she drove like a nun  i could believe that because she looked incapable of the kind of ingret to take a sports coupe off roading in the woods of greater maine  or was she  anyhow  i took this insipid  but yet sporty and near mint condition vehicle with me to colorado  shouldn t sports  cars be more than willing to take the rigors and punishment of a state set on the foundations of four wheel drive  sure  why not  right  about three days later  a fuel injector failed  quite violently  i literally had to break the leg of the dealership to get them to fix the problem  which they wanted to charge  500 00 for the project  that was fixed and i was baffled  several thousand miles later the fuel latch began to fail regularly  the car has now 65 000  one cannot even begin to imagine the despair and anguish i had to go threw by  slamming  and modifying that latch just to get it to close  cold days  anyone  has anyone ever witnessed their automatic door mechanism have a malfunction  well  for harvard s sake  lets just say that now i open and close my door manually by sticking in a rolled paper towel between the spindle and eye  the automatic device on that car is as reliable as a three legged ox  i also hope that i am the only one that notices the passenger side window close lethargically slower than the driver s side  i even went the extra step to clock the turtle like speed of that window  the driver and passenger side should never race  let alone close at the same time  after 65 000 miles  the engine will now vibrate with a precarious  but yet predictable demeanor  shaking after 65 000 miles   good god  i have never raced this car in my life  i treat it like the girlfriend i always wanted  can someone also explain why this pontiac grand  scam s  speakers had to also malfunction  never playing music loud  ever  i took witness to both of my gm issue front speakers disappoint me when they decided to leave my life indefinitely  the refuse failed and now i only have two operating speakers  go figure  the only aspect of the car that i feel confident about is the coherent looks  it has some very stylish enkei rs evolution wheels  about  2000 00  that i basically got free  and a nice wind shield stripe  too bad this will not conceal its image into a ferrari  anyhow  i feel demoralized about buying this car since i do so much to keep it in top condition  the resale value is enough to drive someone insane since i almost paid about  10 000 for it  very little profitable return  please be careful when buying a vehicle  american  because one will not know what one is getting into when endeavoring in such a dangerous  mission  now when i think about it  every car that i have owned was either gm or ford  about six cars in all  and not one has been reliable after 100 000 miles  what does this tell you art  please be very careful and aware of the endless options of purchasing a good vehicle  godspeed and happy hunting art snowfalcon ,someone please explain forsake name wrong american cars periodically

179,camera, kodak dc3400 digital camera compusa  540 i was impressed with my first digital camera   kodak dc210   which i bought two years ago  it died this summer  despite advice from the kodak help line it proved impossible for me to resurrect it and the cost of sending it to the regional repair centre  would you believe that from the uk it would have to be sent to belgium  came close to the cost of buying a new one i chose an updated version that offered higher resolution and many new features  these are my first impressions  for the uninitiated  a digital camera does not use conventional film  but rather uses a memory chip to store the images  the camera comes with a range of cables for connection to the serial  or usb  port of a computer or a tv monitor  it uses 4 aa batteries  has an optional rechargeable battery option  and for static work has a mains adapter  the camera is rated at 2 0 megapixels  1760 x 1180  of picture resolution  twice that of my old one  but lagging behind the high end of the range at over 3 megapixels  this latter is said to equal that of 35 mm film  for snap shots the resolution can be cut from high to low  it has a zoom lens ranging from 38 to 76 mm and an aperture rating from f3 1 to f10 3  there is also an autofocusing mechanism  images are stored in a kodak version of jpeg format  the video output can be adjusted between ntsc and pal there are a range of kodak compactflash cards  10mb to 128 mb  the number of images stored depends on the on the resolution chosen  the supplied 16mb card stores 18  the 96 mb card 90 the camera uses a menu system which is displayed on the view screen at the rear  it can operate in capture mode  review images  connect to a computer or set up  the supplied manual is quite detailed using simple steps to guide through the various operations  there is a built in date   time stamp  it is possible to add borders and use special effects such as black and white or sepia tones  software to transfer and manipulate images on a pcf or macintosh is also supplied which are very simple to use  there is a wide range of optional extras including compactflash card readers  said to be 50 times faster at transferring images to a computer than serial cable  higher power telephoto lenses and creative filter kits  the battery charger comes with a range of plugs that will fit sockets around the world i connected my camera to my computer  photo quality printer and iomega zip drive using a usb hub  i was amazed how easy this  plug and play  facility is  the computer recognised the camera  hot  the software downloaded from the provided cd rom without difficulty   one tip  if like me you have an older camera be sure to use the uninstall facility to get rid of the software and to free up the camera port   there doesn t seem to be any other way to do it the software gives easy access to the pictures on the compactflash card  retitling is straightforward and there are all manner of facilities to manipulate the image and correct minor exposure problems  storage of the jpg files on a zip drive is simplicity itself  i decided to buy an hp photosmart printer  i have been absolutely delighted and truly amazed with the results from this camera   printer combination  focus is pin sharp  colours are deep and rich  it has reawakened in me an interest in photgraphy lost since the demise of my slr many stores now have a facility for d i y printing by merely putting the flash card in to a slot in the apparatus  there are also facilities for transferring jpeg files over the internet to photographic bureaus and receiving hard copy back by mail downsides  i guess kodak now have so many digital camera models each with its own specific version of software that life is getting a bit confusing for retailer and end user  compusa was unable to tell me for instance whether i could use the mains adapter and other cables from my previous camera  as it happens i can   but you need to access kodak s website for a formal compatibility list  overall impression  rather more expensive than the previous model   but you get what you pay for  however it is simplicity itself to use  it is compact  lightweight and can be taken  almost  anywhere  yes   i recommend this camera for the more serious amateur digital photographer or as the base camera for a small business  ,today

180,camera, i chose the kodak dc 210 over a couple of others for several reasons 1  it uses inexpensive batteries   4 aas 2  it uses a flashcard which can be read by a usb reader 3  it looks like a normal camera from the front 4  the price was better than many other cameras i have done photography professionally in the past and so when i began looking for a digital camera i wanted something that was in my price range and yet would give me reasonably high quality photos once i actually got the camera in my hands i was impressed  the actual size of the pictures at the highest resolution is huge  in addition  by using the basic software  i discovered that i could get pretty incredible enlargements  in fact i have found that for web applications i have to reduce the lowest resolution size even more for it to upload and download quickly  my particular camera came with additional software  adobe photodeluxe 2 0 and pagemill 2 0  these applications are helpful and pretty simple to use overall i have really enjoyed and appreciated the ease and quality of this camera  in truth the only real gripes that i have are pretty minor  1  you have to save the pictures into a different format to use them in any program other than the kodak programs 2  the camera is somewhat heavy for its size making long shoots without a tripod a little difficult 3  the power button is a little to close to the shutter button last of all you need to decide before you purchase a camera what exactly you need in the camera and what you can live with  then look long and hard at all of the ones currently on the market  don t just run out to get a camera because someone else has one  check out epinions and ask around about each camera you are interested in  remember that an expensive camera that doesn t do what you need or want is pretty worthless above all  have fun with your camera     ,choose today couple others several reason use expensive batteries use flashcard read us reader look like normal camera front price better many camera do photography professionally past begin look digital camera want something price range yet would give reasonably high quality photo actually get camera hand impress actual size picture highest resolution huge addition use basic software discover could get pretty incredible enlargements fact find web applications reduce lowest resolution size even unload download quickly particular camera come additional software adore photodeluxe pagemill applications helpful pretty simple use overall really enjoy appreciate ease quality camera truth real grapes pretty minor save picture different format use program today program camera somewhat heavy size make long shoot without try little difficult power button little close shutter button last need decide purchase camera exactly need camera live look long hard ones currently market run get camera someone else one check opinions ask around camera interest remember expensive camera need want pretty worthless fun camera
181,camera, as a person who never gets around to developing film  i thought a digital camera would be a great thing to have  i found this little guy at walmart for under  200 00  and was impressed with what features it has  the resolution compares with much more expensive cameras  in fact  the only other cameras in this price range were only 640x480 or less  the results are clear and crisp  and if printed on photo paper  look just as good printed the only downside is the lack of a manual  on screen help is worthless if you re not taking pictures in the house  and the icons on the camera s menu aren t really user friendly  the color lcd screen is bright and sharp  except for outside in strong light  and the picture preview is handy  you can delete a shot instantly if it doesn t look right  and free up the memory for another picture  you can also hook this to your tv or vcr with the provided cable and preview pictures  save them on tape  or even use the camera as a low quality cam corder  if you don t mind filming all the action within a 5  radius of the vcr  due to cord length also handy is the separate black and white lcd on the top of the camera  it has a battery level indicator  displays what resolution your pictures are in  fine  very fine  and normal  and how many shots are left in each mode  the higher the quality  the less shots the memory will hold  on the main menu  accessed on the color screen  you can set the quality to xga or vga  xga being the best  so you end up having access to 6 different film quality settings  with xga very fine being the best  and vga normal being the lowest quality  but still very adequate  the flash mode indicator is also on the top lcd  off  on  and auto  even inside you don t need to use the flash very often  due to the fact that you can also choose the available lighting level on the main menu  sunlight  lamp light  etc  the indoor shots i did use the flash on came out overexposed until i turned the flash completely off  then they were perfect i d recommend this for anyone that wants a digital camera  but doesn t need all the high end options on more expensive models br br  ,person never get around develop film think digital camera would great thing find little guy palmar impress feature resolution compare much expensive camera fact camera price range less result clear crisp print photo paper look good print downside lack manual screen help worthless take picture house icons camera menu really user friendly color lead screen bright sharp except outside strong light picture review handy delete shoot instantly look right free memory another picture also hook ver provide cable review picture save tape even use camera low quality order mind fill action within radius ver due cord length also handy separate black white lead top camera battery level indicator display resolution picture fine fine normal many shots leave mode higher quality less shots memory hold main menu access color screen set quality ga va ga best end access different film quality settings ga fine best va normal lowest quality still adequate flash mode indicator also top lead auto even inside need use flash often due fact also choose available light level main menu sunlight lamp light etc indoor shots use flash come overexpose turn flash completely perfect recommend anyone want digital camera need high end option expensive model br

183,camera, the exterior of the camera is very nice       sleek looking and professional  it s portable and light  fitting easily in a pocket  a plus for the weekend photographer  unfortunately  being a mother of three  a camera at the ready is a necessity  this particular tool takes a few seconds to set the ideal shooting option  and if it sits idle for only a short time it automatically shuts off  which is a plus as far as battery preservation  but forces you to have to go through the process of turning the camera on and picking the shooting option again before actually taking the picture  this can be frustrating when taking pictures of kids who are always on the go  i have also found that there is a problem with quality pictures  and there seems to be a toss up as to whether the picture will turn out clear  or blurry  i have found it takes clear pictures more consistently outdoors than in  and if the lighting is ideal  it does hold up to 70 pictures  and has a very bright flash  which helps with some of the blurry indoor pictures a bit the camera does double as a web cam  which i find is ideal  it comes with a photo program  arcsoft photo impression  that is simple to use  allowing you to not only view and alter pictures that you have taken away from the computer  but also shoots live videos and gives you the opportunity  if your computer and video card allows  to make movies with the avi maker  it only takes 2 aa batteries which last a long time thanks to the battery saver feature that shuts off the camera when it is idle for a short period of time  it connects to the computer by usb port  i had to replace the port after a small household accident on my part  when i went to replace it  i found that both ends of the cable were identical  which posed a problem  i ended up having to go to a computer specific store to find the correct cable to replace the one i broke  ,exterior camera nice sleek look professional portable light fit easily pocket plus weekend photographer unfortunately mother three camera ready necessity particular tool take second set ideal shoot option sit idle short time automatically shut plus far battery preservation force go process turn camera pick shoot option actually take picture frustration take picture kiss always go also find problem quality picture seem toss whether picture turn clear flurry find take clear picture consistently outdoor light ideal hold picture bright flash help flurry indoor picture bite camera double web find ideal come photo program arcsoft photo impression simple use allow view alter picture take away computer also shoot live video give opportunity computer video card allow make move vi maker take batteries last long time thank battery save feature shut camera idle short period time connect computer us port replace port small household accident part go replace find end cable identical pose problem end go computer specific store find correct cable replace one break
184,camera, quick update december 2003 about 3 500 photos on and it s still going strong  it s not had a rough life  but i take it  everywhere  i go  and has been dropped a few times onto carpeted floor accidentally  and survived i ve added more memory cards  they re only us 40 now  it s still a shame that smartmedia s limit is 128mb  but that s enough for 150 high quality pix  some memory cards are definitely faster than others  so it s worth looking at better brands  apparently power consumption can vary by 75  too  but i can t tell you how to determine the best card as the full technical specifications are rarely published  all i can say is that with the small difference in prices when buying online  to go for a good name brand my father has now gone digital and bought a canon a60  although in theory his camera should be better  the images are noticeably very slightly worse especially in poorer light  i was puzzled by this  naturally  as i thought technology should have moved on after some investigation i found out that not only have very few mid range digital cameras matched the lens that olympus fitted to the c3040z and its replacements  but in this model oly fitted a 1 1 8  ccd image sensor  whilst other manufacturers were fitting and have continued to fit smaller sensors  the extra 30  area increase over the 1 2 5  and f1 8 vs the typical f2 6 lens means there s more light for the sensor to work without noise in practise  from what i ve read  3m to 4m is about the optical limit of resolution for typical digicam ccds and their lenses   it s only when you get to the larger sizes used by the slr type cameras and the quality of lenses  adding more pixels to the sensors simply gives each one less light  and the smaller lenses simply don t have the resolution update 29th may 2002 i have now lived with my 3040z for a year and have a few more things to add firstly  memory  the oly uses smartmedia  which i think is a dying format  as compact flash seems to be the way of the future  so  my advice is to make sure you buy at least one spare card if you re ever going to need it the largest sm card you can buy is still only 128mb  which i think is a design limit  though cf now goes up to 1gb  however  the card does hold  150 pictures in high quality mode  these are 700k per image  roughly  the picture quality in this mode is very good  more than good enough to print a 10x8  new cards are now less than  60 for third party makes  but then you don t get the panorama feature  i m told that oly have a special firmware fix to make their cards do something special to enable panorama feature  that you would with oly media  i ve got two 128mb cards  one is oly  and the original oly 8mb which came from the camera  and only twice ever had to use the 2nd card  so it s not a big deal  i sometimes used my olympus to store downloaded files  there s a leased line at work  and i only have a modem at home  hence would like bigger memory secondly  speed  the small delay when you press the shutter button has been a bit of a niggle  it s ok when taking portraits  landscapes etc  but for motorsport it requires a lot of practise to anticipate  you can help by pre focussing  but you end up taking a lot of bad pictures  my advice is  before buying any digital camera  to try and borrow one of that type from a friend to see if you can live with it  i ve learned to live and love  despite faults  my oly thirdly  3rd party s w  i have discovered a really nifty bit of windows software which allows you to remote control your olympus camera  and do things like time lapse photography  reconfigure it etc  find it at http www pinetreecomputing com camctl asp finding this program was a real blessing  i love it  you ll be wanting a mains adaptor if you want to do any time lapse photography though apart from that  my 3040z has been trouble free despite getting quite wet at times  has only ever had one corrupted picture  low battery  so my fault  and many people have commented on the good picture quality  i still recommend it  reviews of the 4040z indicate that the extra resolution doesn t give you a benefit  because the size of the lens and the ccd is the limiting factor  however  they have improved the firmware  so unless you re not saving a packet  the 3040z will probably do everything you want and probably is much better value for money than the 4040z some sample photos from my vacation last year in california here  http paul motorbiking fotopic net show collection php id 1982 i made no special attempts to clean up these photos  they have only been cropped i have now lived with my oly 3040z for two months and taken a wide variety of pictures with it and a few motion jpeg movies  i have taken pictures in normal daylight  dusk  and night time  and generally been quite impressed i would agree with other s findings that the flash can often over expose  it s easy to tweak it down to  0 3 in the menus  so it s not really a big deal i bought the camera with a second genuine olympus 128mb memory card  as only olympus memory has a specific feature allowing panorama stitching  when i last looked  late may 2001  olympus memory cards were about 30  more expensive than standard ones i tried the camedia master software which came with the camera  on both my windows 2000 machine  a laptop  and desktop win98  and it is ok except neither machine recognise the camera is connected  so i can t do any fancy setup tricks  however  you can crop  rotate  not lossless i think  and resize pictures  and save with different quality levels  there s also a  panorama  stitch feature in the software  which i haven t used which automates the process a bit  overall i would recommend instead using  irfanview  or acdsee  search http www tucows com for them  as both support lossless jpeg rotation  irfanview needs some plugins for this the movie file format is motion jpeg  and you play it with quicktime  http quicktime apple com  the camera allows you to change the start and end of the movie  creating a new movie or overwriting the old one  which is handy if you don t have any quicktime editing software  the free quicktime player doesn t allow this  the paid for one does  pros excellent picture quality and excellent lens  and you can get adaptor to allow use of video camera tele wide adaptors  i have a 2x tele converter  and a 0 5x wideangle converter  these are about gbp100 or usd140 each for reasonable quality items good battery life   takes 4 aa batteries  so you can buy spares in any store if you ve run down your rechargeables  and much cheaper to buy extra rechargeable batteries than say camcorder ones  it also means you can use the same charger  which helps when you go on holiday  the genuine olympus charger is quite good  and is universal voltage  even though the pack doesn t say so  you don t even have to remember to switch it over automatic mode is relatively foolproof   it gets it right most of the time  and a little practise with the exposure lock means 99  of my photos were easy semi auto and manual exposure modes are useful  but i found the exposure lock to be good enough so i don t need to change modes much at all has manual focus and focus lock option  occasionally useful  though manual focus is quite fiddly and would take too long to use for anything other than still life it takes pictures quickly  and is ready for the next shot in seconds  except in raw tiff mode the video  motion jpeg  is fun and occasionally useful  and you can edit the movie in the camera very easily very easy to connect to computer  i use windows 2000  just plug into usb port  and the cable is supplied flash sync modes allow trick night time photos   first or second curtain in slow flash sync mode  there s a tiny connector for an external flash gun  which might be very useful can connect to tv or vcr to make a slideshow tape  mono sound  composite video only    the lead is supplied remembers your settings including all the customisations and is easy to reset back to factory the tripod screw hole is nice and robust  and central the battery compartment locks securely the lcd screen is easily viewable in daylight  you only need to shield it a little bit in sunlight  cons doesn t come with rechargeable batteries  but given it uses four aa cells  these are quite cheap from any decent store like frys or bestbuy   make sure you get at least 1200mah capacity cells though  i bought the real olympus ones with the oly charger  which are 1400mah capacity and last a very long time viewfinder is slightly awkward at first like other digital cameras  pressing shutter button isn t immediate the video  motion jpeg  takes just a bit too long to start up to be useful for spontaneous  filming i couldn t switch between ntsc and pal video out  so beware if you buy abroad where video system is different  most new tvs in europe will accept ntsc  but you can t record with a vcr of course unless you buy an expensive  gbp100 or more  converter raw tiff mode is very slow  which is to be expected front element of lens is hardly recessed  and it s not possible to protect with a filter  so you do need to be careful when handling  the lens cap can fall off easily  so i ve managed to put some big juicy fingerprints on the lens when the cap has fallen off and i m groping inside the camera bag when connected to tv  the slideshow always has some overlay of information which spoils the presentation a little  and it can take a while to flick between pages   there s a blank screen for a significant fraction of a second the bottom line  as good as anything i ll ever want  ,quick update december photo still go strong rough life take everywhere go drop time onto carpet

185,auto, my interest in this marquee started out with the earlier range rover model  i was quite interested in acquiring what had been dubbed the  quot the most competent four wheel drive vehicle in the world quot however  i was left with a lot of doubt as to the credibility of this rather desirable automobile  first reason for doubt was the range rover s dubious and rather shameful reliability  this so called competent mud rucker had not endeared itself to owners all over the world with it s dubious track record on reliability  in fact  as i was hunting around for a bargain basement used   or as we say now  pre owned range rover  i found myself being deterred by   of all people   car dealers all over  i then went to a trusted friend in studio city to try to acquire this vehicle that i desired  he bluntly refused to sell me the one he had actually owned  this from a guy who treated his automobiles almost as a substitute for children  he regaled me with horror stories of trying to keep his range rover serviceable  infact he stated that he would never buy a range rover that was out of warranty  so  after feeling rather let down in my quest to acquire this automobile  i was to come to face another issue i had with the range rover  for an over  50 000 luxury automobile  it was small inside  i am 6 3 quot  tall  and can compete with most professional quarterbacks for build  i was rather disappointed by this  i don t know about you  however if i am paying that much money for a car  i would like to be able to enjoy it  and i mean really enjoy  i am not just acquiring the range rover to prove my social worth or accomplishments  or to say that i appreciate crumpets and tea or a game of polo  also  it was not to grin in pain at my neighbours as i come home from la s infamous traffic jams with my knees having lost all sensation by the time i come home  however  almost like a call to me from the marquee s manufacturer  a second edition of the range rover was released  this was the range rover town and country lwb  long wheel base  i found from test driving this car that there was more room for daddy long legs   me  at last it seemed i would be able to enjoy this luxurious marquee  however  based on the dismal reputation that the range rover seemed to have built thus far  i found my desire to acquire this vehicle was not enough to make me fork out the mulla to buy it the beginning of this review was based on the past  rover has now introduced the new range rover  and it has been with us for a few years now  fewer years than our cousins in queen s country have had the new range rover  i have again found my desire for this majestic mud rucker piqued  the new range rover now has a fair amount of pre owned examples to choose from  therefore i decided to again go out and try to quell my desire initially  i was not too taken by the look of the new range rover  it somehow seemed bland in design  almost as generic as a lot of new automobiles seemed to be during the late eighties into the nineties  however  as time went on as i started to pay a closer look at this marquee  i realized that range rover had actually created a new range rover while preserving the traditional look and dare i say lines of the older model  it was more of an evolutionary design if not wildly revolutionary  as time wore on  i also realized it was actually distinguishable from other suv s on the road  if you did not recognize her majesty s official mudrucker by it s new design  then i found you could hardly miss it s share size  it had presence and visual dominance on the road when it appeared  and at the same time  it exuded it s elegance and class  i often joked that it was what a suburban would look like in a tuxedo  it was james bond on steroids after deciding that the new range rover had a face that not only a mother could love  but one that i had come to appreciate  i decided that it was time for me to go put it through it s paces  now what i wanted was to be able to spend a bundle of hard earned dollars on an suv that would make me feel like royalty forgive the pun  but this vehicle had to be reliable enough to where it would need a third mortgage to maintain   the second mortgage bought it  it also had to be comfortable enough as a long distance hauler and a traffic jam haven  now  i did mention the part of feeling like royalty  well  no doubt a lot of people will say this is a trait of and angeleno  but i wanted my suv to have enough snob appeal to say class without being  to crass  i first began my quest by researching the new range rover s reliability  much to by delight  it was rave reviews all the way  things like  quot  i have been delighted with the performance of my rover to date quot  and this would be two to three years later  or from my dear friend in studio city   quot i am glad that i decided to try another rover  for once i did not have to wear out my warranty quot  so with this positive feedback already on the side of the new range rover  i went in search of the ideal candidate to literally fill my garage  i also went to a couple of large range rover dealers to see if i can obtain an even more knowledgeable review of the car s reliability  even though i was expecting to get somewhat biased reviews  i was still pleased to hear that the car was indeed proving it s reliability  when i went out in search of my ideal candidate  i was quite in amazed at the number of range rovers available to the used car buyer  and also the asking price for them  to say that depreciation was rather harsh to this automobile would be an understatement to me  i found quite a handful of range rovers ranging in age between 18 months to two years old  the average mileage was between 38 000 to 50 000 miles  to me  the examples i found were quite clean and well kept  after all  the truth of the matter is that not all of us can afford these marquees new  the prices i found ranged from  32 000 for newer ones with lower miles to  29 000 for slightly older ones with mileage in the high forties to fifties  i thought this was not a bad deal  considering this meant up to  20

186,camera, after doing a lot of searching on the  net and looking at what some of my friends were using the olympus was definitely the way to go  my only complaints are the smallish memory card that is provided  and the fact that the lens cap provides a problem if you forget to take it off before turning it on  i looked at the nikon 885 and 995 as well as the canon s30 and s40  definitely go to circuit city or best buy to play with these cameras  i chose the olympus when you consider the nikon will shoot quicktime movies but without sound  the canon will shoot movies with sound  the canon s port cover seemed very flimsy  i d probably break in under a month  probably the other leg up nikon and canon had was the use of compact flash  more durable  vice smart media card  but if you re banging your camera around i think you ll have other issues before the memory durability becomes a problem  as far as image quality goes i m sure they are all in about the same league so the cosmetics were the key for me  also liked the ability to use add on lenses  no go for the canon  software looks like it will be very good  i especially like the fact that the macintosh software isn t some stripped down 3 year old version  image transfer was flawless once i downloaded the usb mass storage drive 1 3 5 from apple  the was also pointed out in the manual  very comprehensive  the only nitpicky thing i saw was the fact that you need the olympus cards to shoot panoramic photos no third party cards  the photos that i ve taken are sharp and clear  and of course if you don t like the shot  delete it  i had the camera out of the box and was shooting photos in under 5 minutes  the fast lens and quick cycle times are great when you ve got children who rarely wait for the camera to cycle   bottom line b  this is a great camera especially for the price that i paid  i recommend it to anyone with our reservation  ,lot search net look friends use polypus definitely way go complaints smallish memory card provide fact lens cap provide problem forget take turn look union well canon definitely go circuit city best buy play camera choose polypus consider union shoot quicktime move without sound canon shoot move sound canon port cover seem fly probably break month probably leg union canon use compact flash unable vice smart media card bang camera around think issue memory disability become problem far image quality go sure league cosmetic key also like ability use add lenses go canon software look like good especially like fact mackintosh software strip year old version image transfer lawless download us mass storage drive apple also point manual comprehensive nitpicky thing saw fact need polypus card shoot panorama photo third party card photo take sharp clear course like shoot delete camera box shoot photo minutes fast lens quick cycle time great get children rarely wait camera cycle bottom line great camera especially price pay recommend anyone reservation

192,camera, i received the s20 as a graduation gift from college  it is my first digital camera  but i have worked a lot with conventional photography the most notable feature of the s20 is that it defies the current industry paradigm of choosing between size and quality  it may not have the best quality out there  although 3 3 megapixels is phenomenal  but it is smaller than most point and shoot 35mm or even aps cameras  this allows it to take pictures of astonishing quality  but be used as a daytrip go anywhere camera  this  in my opinion  is its greatest strength even at medium quality with medium compression  it takes 1024x768 photos  44 to a 16mb flash card  of excellent quality  in its highest quality mode  the pictures don t even come close to fitting on my 1600x1200 resolution computer screen  simply amazing it has several impressive features as well  while you can put it in automatic mode where the camera chooses everything  i have always been most enamored of cameras that allow you to control the elements of the construction of the picture as well  the canon s20 does it all   it supports rapid shooting  multi frame  single frame shooting  and timer modes   it has automatic  sunlight  and indoor color balancing modes  a feat conventional cameras can only achieve through different films and filters it has 4 flash modes  automatic  red eye reduction  no flash and force flash  flash no matter what it supports free zoom between 6 5 and 13mm and a macro mode for close up shots its rear display is bright and clear even in sunlight and can be turned on or off depending on how much battery life is a concern to you as far as construction goes  the entire housing of the camera is metal  giving you the feeling of a durable camera  but the whole package remains light and small enough to fit in your pocket in the 5 months i ve owned mine  i have taken hundreds of pictures  and the camera has never failed to capture even the most difficult lighting conditions to my satisfaction  all in all  i would suggest this camera to anyone wanting to buy a digital camera provided it falls within your budget  the  800 price tag is quite hefty br br  ,receive granulation gift college first digital camera work lot conventional photography notable feature define current industry paradise choose size quality may best quality although megapixels phenomena smaller point shoot mm even camera allow take picture astonish quality use daytrip go anywhere camera opinion greatest strength even medium quality medium compression take photo mb flash card excellent quality highest quality mode picture even come close fit resolution computer screen simply amaze several impressive feature well put automatic mode camera choose everything always clamor camera allow control elements construction picture well canon support rapid shoot multi frame single frame shoot time modes automatic sunlight indoor color balance modes feat conventional camera achieve different film filter flash modes automatic red eye reduction flash force flash matter support free room mm micro mode close shots rear display bright clear even sunlight turn depend much battery life concern far construction go entire house camera metal give feel unable camera whole package remain light small enough fit pocket months own mine take hundreds picture camera never fail capture even difficult light condition satisfaction would suggest camera anyone want buy digital camera provide fall within budget price tag quite hetty br
193,camera, like many others  i bought this camera as a low cost way to start taking digital pictures  299 during summer of 1999  i also really liked the picture transfer method  the files are stored on a small card that can be inserted into a floppy adapter and used in your computer like a 3 5 quot  drive  no cables  also it comes with an ac adapter  which i found was extra for most other cameras  turns out i never use the adapter though the missing features that i was willing to overlook were lack of zoom  and 640x480 max resolution  i find that 640x480 is just fine for me  i just want pictures i can put on the web  i m not really a photography enthusiast it is the missing feature that i accidentally overlooked that has made me somewhat unhappy with this camera  no autofocus  there are 3 manual focus settings  close up  medium  and far away  if you do not switch to the appropriate setting  you are pretty much guaranteed to get a blurry picture  it might not be so hard to remember this if the view in the viewfinder was blurry too  but it is just a small glass window that doesn t go through the lens  so it always looks fine  so i use the wrong setting about 20  of the time i still think this is a decent camera  the viewfinder looks good  battery lasts pretty well  and again  the price is right  the focus is really my only complaint  but it is a big one  so unless you have a great memory or take pictures from the exact same distance all the time  be ready for a few blurry disappointments oh  one more problem  the floppy adapter drivers do not work with windows nt  i have to download the pictures on my girlfriends windows 95 computer instead of my nt one new addition  08 16 2000  my camera just broke after 14 months  2 months after the warranty expired  i now despise this camera br br  ,like many others buy camera low cost way start take digital picture summer also really like picture transfer method file store small card insert floppy adapt use computer like quit drive table also come ac adapt find extra camera turn never use adapt though miss feature will overlook lack room max resolution find fine want picture put web really photography enthusiast miss feature accidentally overlook make somewhat unhappy camera autofocus manual focus settings close medium far away switch appropriate set pretty much guarantee get flurry picture might hard remember view viewfinder flurry small glass window go lens always look fine use wrong set time still think decent camera viewfinder look good battery last pretty well price right focus really complaint big one unless great memory take picture exact distance time ready flurry disappointments oh one problem floppy adapt drivers work windows download picture girlfriend windows computer instead one new addition camera break months warranty expire despise camera br

196,camera, i purchased a pdc 700 camera at a clearance sale 8 months ago for  99  it came with some accessories such as a case  three cables usb serial tv out  ac adapter  and all software  first i must say that i was not looking for a high price  high resolution camera  i wanted something i could take some auction photos and fun shots with  the sub  100 cameras at the time were not up to my standards  but this one which listed at  249 was  it s easy to install  and with usb and tv out easy to hook up and transfer photos  a compactflash slot allows for expandibility of picture capacity  the quality of the photos is about what you would expect for a 1 megapixel camera even though it has 764k pixels  sharp enough to put full size 1024x768 on your screen  but not incredibly sharp when printed out  forget about enlargements with this one  photos can be taken in three resolution modes  and with the finest the camera will hold 12 pictures  the middle mode is alright for quick snaps and allows for more than double that amount of pictures  on the bad side  there is a delay of 10 15 seconds between taking pictures which can be annoying if you have to take several in a row  battery life is short  very  very short it is not uncommon for me to have to change batteries after only 15 20 pictures  use of the lcd screen dramatically reduces the battery life  the camera is bulky and heavy  not exactly pocket size  and if you could get it in there it would probably tear right through your pocket  it is quite awkward to hold as well  i can t even count how many times i thought i d taken a great picture  only to find upon further examination that my finger was in the way of the shot  in the end  it all comes down to  you get what you pay for  don t expect to buy this camera and have a high end digital  because it s not  it s one of the best of the low end cameras  because many of the other ones almost seem like toys   jam cam  and take photos that look like they were beamed from pluto  if however  you are looking for a digicam that won t break the bank  and don t care about enlarging and framing your photos  then the polaroid pdc 700 may be for you  ,purchase camera clearance sale months ago come accessories case three table us aerial ac adapt software first must say look high price high resolution camera want something could take auction photo fun shots sub camera time standards one list easy install us easy hook transfer photo compactflash slot allow expandibility picture capacity quality photo would expect megapixel camera even though pip sharp enough put full size screen incredibly sharp print forget enlargements one photo take three resolution modes finest camera hold picture middle mode alright quick snap allow double amount picture bad side delay second take picture annoy take several row battery life short short uncommon change batteries picture use lead screen dramatically reduce battery life camera bulky heavy exactly pocket size could get would probably tear right pocket quite awkward hold well even count many time think take great picture find upon examination finger way shoot end come get pay expect buy camera high end digital one best low end camera many ones almost seem like toy jam take photo look like beam plato however look digital break bank care enlarge frame photo polaroid may

198,camera, 9 00 last december  i received the camera as a gift  i was thrilled at finally getting into the digital revolution  i am now questioning my prior emotions  i am not an avid photographer actually i used to hate taking photos  i was under the impression that a digital camera would be more convenient and less costly  both of those are true  but the images are not nearly as clear as a 35mm camera to make things simple i would like to outline the benefits of the agfa digital camera versus a standard 33mm camera pros 1  get to view the images instantly with the digital camera 2  can delete images that you do not like  and don t have to pay for developing 3  for people who like toys  it is just that 4  very easy to upload images to a computer  then on to an email or printer cons 1  printing a digital image is just as costly as 33mm 2  memory packs run out of space quickly  unless you take poor resolution photos 3  no zoom  the camera lets you crop an image and then increase the size  but that is not the same as a zoom 4  the initial cost of the camera is much more expensive than a standard 33mm assuming the choice is not between digital and 33mm here are the pros and cons of the agfa digital camera versus other digital cameras pros 1  uses standard aa batteries  a 4 pack of aa from radio shack with a charger costs about  20 2  easy to use  the controls are simple 3  usb port makes it very easy to upload images to a computer  the s video makes it simple to view images on a tv 4  low cost   about  250 cons 1  poor image quality i hope i have helped with your decision br br  ,last december receive camera gift thrill finally get digital revolution question prior emotions aid photographer actually use hate take photo impression digital camera would convenient less costly true image nearly clear mm camera make things simple would like outline benefit agra digital camera versus standard mm camera pro get view image instantly digital camera delete image like pay develop people like toy easy unload image computer email printer sons print digital image costly mm memory pack run space quickly unless take poor resolution photo room camera let crop image increase size room initial cost camera much expensive standard mm assume choice digital mm pro sons agra digital camera versus digital camera pro use standard batteries pack radio shock charge cost easy use control simple us port make easy unload image computer video make simple view image low cost sons poor image quality hope help decision br
199,camera, i have had 2 other brand digital cameras and this is the only one that worked for over a month  i am an online auction seller and take a number of pictures nearly every day  i have had this camera for nearly a year and it still works like a charm first of all  after loading the batteries and memory card you simply push the spring loaded power switch and the camera is almost instantly ready to take a photo  you may then turn the dial on the right hand side of the camera to the play icon to review the photos that you have taken or to the trashcan icon to delete any unwanted photos secondly  after installing and configuring the software you may download the photos to your computer by simply attaching the serial cable to the computer and camera and switching the turn dial to the computer icon and clicking a few buttons on your computer  this process is however very slow  it takes around 5 20 minuets to download the pictures to the computer depending on picture quality and amount the camera takes excellent close up macro photos when configured properly  in this mode you may get the camera as close as 3 inches from the subject to take a photo  you may find that when in the macro mode the camera will display a camera shaking notice  you must set the camera to forced flash in order to get rid of this message and take focused and properly rendered close up photos  the bundled software is not exactly one of the cameras better features  it has an old not very user friendly interface  i would personally recommend that you use adobe photo deluxe or a similar software package to edit your pictures finally  the fuji mx 1200 is a great deal for the money  it is excellent to put in a purse or pocket for quick snapshots on the fly  i would highly recommend this camera to anyone as a first time camera or for a teenager br br  ,brand digital camera one work month online auction seller take number picture nearly every day camera nearly year still work like charm first load batteries memory card simply push spring load power switch camera almost instantly ready take photo may turn dial right hand side camera play icon review photo take trashcan icon delete unwanted photo secondly instal configure software may download photo computer simply attach aerial cable computer camera twitch turn dial computer icon clink button computer process however slow take around minutes download picture computer depend picture quality amount camera take excellent close micro photo configure properly mode may get camera close inch subject take photo may find micro mode camera display camera shake notice must set camera force flash order get rid message take focus properly render close photo bundle software exactly one camera better feature old user friendly interface would personally recommend use adore photo deluge similar software package edit picture finally full great deal money excellent put purse pocket quick snapshots fly would highly recommend camera anyone first time camera teenager br

201,camera, i am not quite sold on the whole digital camera thing  but there is so much talk about it  i had to find just the right inexpensive model and give it a try now keep in mind  i take about 2 3 rolls of film a week with a very nice slr camera that does a lot  and i wanted a digital camera about the same for a hundred bucks  giggle  but this is close the price is right the software is cool  and i am starting to get the hang of it downloading pictures to the computer is kind of confusing  but i am still trying pictures are very easy to make  i love the 1 8  color led display monitor  it could be better  but beggars can t be choosers so far i think this is a great camera for the person who is inquisitive about digital cameras  but if you want a good camera  pay a little more and shop a little more  ,quite sell whole digital camera thing much talk find right expensive model give try keep mind take roll film week nice sir camera lot want digital camera hundred buck giggler close price right software cool start get hang download picture computer kind confuse still try picture easy make love color lead display monitor could better beggar choose far think great camera person inquisitive digital camera want good camera pay little shop little
202,camera, i love this camera  i used  and have kept  my trusty olympus d450z for almost 2 years  and became hooked on a digital camera  the d450z was great except   the 1 3megapixel ccd did limit me to at most 5x7 prints  it used a slow serial port transfer  the 3x optical zoom was just not sufficient for too many pictures i wanted to take the c700uz with its 2 1megapixels  usb  and 10x zoom has solved all these issues  i am not by any means a professional photographer  and to get professional reviews  i suggest going to  http www imaging resource com  http www steves digicams com  http www dpreview com http www cnet com i will provide here a general user s review  my main interests in picture taking have been of family pictures  indoor and outdoor  my kids  sports  soccer and basketball  and vacation and scenery  family pictures work well  and the flash unit is quite acceptable  sports pictures have worked very well for outdoor events  i have discovered that you need to take many sports action pictures to get one decent one  using a digital camera i can as many pictures as i want and only keep the good ones  of course  the camera has an action setting  and the 10x zoom has been invaluable for getting some incredible soccer pictures  i do recommend  however  that you use a tripod to help steady the camera   the olympus 2100uz does come with an image stabilization feature  but the camera is significantly larger  for my uses  i wanted the smaller size  trying to take indoor basketball pictures has not been very successful  but it may have to do with the poor lighting in the gyms  scenery pictures have also been excellent  but i have occasionally encountered what is called chromatic aberration  in high contrast areas of a picture  for example  a bright sky behind the dark leaves of a tree  the pictures appear with a purplish tinge around them  it isn t particularly glaring or problematic  but it happens frequently enough on that really great picture that you will want to try to tone it down  it can easily be done with the high end photo editing software  eg  photoshop  but the cheapest  free  and easiest way to do it is with serif s photoplus 5 0  this free download  http www serif com downloads asp  allows you to select a tonal range across an entire picture and then reduce its contrast   i have not found any other mid  to low end product that can do this  photodeluxe  pictureit  photodraw  image composer  photoimpact  smartphoto  other scattered observations  the camera comes with an 8mb smartmedia card  you will find heated discussions about the superiority of one of the media formats smartmedia  compactflash  memory stick  etc but i have been very pleased with smartmedia  it is small  and it is now also cheap   i have purchased a 64mb card for  35  some people prefer to have a high mb card  but i have gone with cards in the 16  32  or 64 range both because they are cheaper and because i won t lose everything if i should happen to lose one card  i have also purchased a microtek cameramate usb smartmedia cf reader  i use it to download images from the card without always having to use the camera  which does come with a usb transfer cable  i can also use this device and the sm cards as portable storage devices for any file type  the camera comes with a new lithium ion battery pack  but you will quickly want to get nimh rechargeable batteries  battery life in general is quite good  i can take about 150 shots or so  viewing  deleting  etc on one set of charged batteries  i like the clamshell design on my old d450z  the c700uz is larger  but it is still unbelievably compact for a 10x optical zoom  many of the older olympus models had a lens capped that dropped off when the camera was turned on  but the c700uz lens cap now has a retainer cord  once you have a 10x optical zoom  it is hard to go to anything else   i never even bother with the digital zoom  you can enlarge pictures later on the computer  the camera comes with an ntsc a v cable so you can plug the camera into a tv or vcr and view your pictures onscreen  it s a great way to share pictures  note that many other cameras do not have this feature  the included camedia software is fine  but i find that i mostly use the built in preview feature of windows explorer on my winme system  you will want another photoediting program to do any significant editing  the 1 5  tft lcd works quite well  even in bright outdoor light  you can even shoot up to 15 second movies with this camera  they aren t the greatest quality  but it is a nice extra feature  the viewfinder is not a through the lens type but is  as i understand it  actually a mini lcd panel  the advantage to it is that your picture comes out just as you see it  the disadvantage is that there is some loss of detail  and it can be a bit dim  it works well enough  the camera can be used pretty much as a point and shoot if you want using the auto setting  you do have other automatic settings  landscapes  portraits  action  and if you want  you can take full control of all settings  i find that the automatic settings are useful for most purposes  but i do some manual settings when i want to do macro mode  play around with flash effects  when i want to set white balance settings under different lighting situations  eg  flourescent  or adjust iso settings  the camera has an amazing iso 800 equivalency which is great for low light shots  it is possible to buy a cla 4 adaptor and add lens  filters  etc to this camera  i have settled on using the highquality jpeg setting  each picture uses about 450k or so  the quality is excellent for producing up to 8x10  prints  i keep all my pictures on my computer and burn to cd  i print some of the pictures on my inkjet  for pictures i want as prints  i upload to sites like ofoto or clubphoto  i recently have begun using walmart s services and have been satisfied  to really get all the potential out of this camera  which i am not doing  you need to read the manual  there is a brief starter manual printed  but you really have to read the full manual which only comes on the included cd  the camera feels well balanced and well made and has been quite durable and sturdy  i waited until bestbuy had one of their 10  off anything 3 day sales to get my camera at a price comparable to the best online price available  ,love camera use keep trusty polypus almost years become hook digital camera great except megapixel cod limit print use slow aerial port transfer optical room sufficient many

204,camera, i purchased my mvc fd71 about a year and a half ago  and have taken over 1 000 snapshots with it  one of the nicest features of the mavica line is the fact that shots are put onto standard 1 44mb floppy disks  it s not very difficult to carry a number of these around with you  and since you can delete pictures and reuse the disks  you can end up with unlimited shots  if you have trouble taking good photos  having unlimited tries to get one shot right helps  the lcd screen lets you preview your work  so you don t have to be tied to your pc to see if you got the shot  and you never have to go through waiting for film to be developed to find out your shots were no good ever again there are a few things that can be improved with this particular camera model  however  it has a 10x zoom  but it would be nice to be able to use interchangeable lenses to get more range when you need it  the lithium battery that comes with it lasts quite a while  but you can t take any shots while it is recharging unless you sink 50 to 100 bucks on a spare  the resolution on the camera can be set to a few different levels  but the highest res picture available is a 640 x 480 bitmap  which takes up an entire floppy  many other cameras boast 800 x 600 pictures as a minimal setting  with even higher resolutions available  and have memory cards that allow many more pictures to be taken overall  the mavica does the job for me  i can take shots of anything i want  and if i take my time  i can take shots that rival what i d take with a normal camera  combine the mavica with a good quality printer  and you may never need to take film photographs again  any and all photos you see on my website  once i put the site back up  were taken with my mavica  including the pic of me on my profile here on epinions if you have a high end computer with usb ports or a port made for the memory cards from other cameras  or if you need to take super high quality photographs  you may want to look elsewhere  as for me  i m happy with my purchase br br  ,purchase mac ff year half ago take snapshots one nicest feature mavra line fact shots put onto standard mb floppy disk difficult carry number around since delete picture refuse disk end unlimited shots trouble take good photo unlimited try get one shoot right help lead screen let review work tie pp see get shoot never go wait film develop find shots good ever things improve particular camera model however room would nice able use interchangeable lenses get range need lithium battery come last quite take shots charge unless sink buck spare resolution camera set different level highest yes picture available batman take entire floppy many camera boast picture minimal set even higher resolutions available memory card allow many picture take overall mavra job take shots anything want take time take shots rival take normal camera combine mavra good quality printer may never need take film photograph photo see webster put site back take mavra include pick profile opinions high end computer us port port make memory card camera need take super high quality photograph may want look elsewhere happy purchase br
205,auto,  my saab b 1982 saab 900s number of doors  2 door transmission  5 speed manual engine  fuel injected  4 cylinder  2 0 liter  110 horsepower  sohc extras  sunroof  air conditioning b how i got my first and only saab  during my junior year of college i commuted in a 1982 oldsmobile omega  this was not a good car  the 1982 omega featured the infamous chevy built 2 8 liter v 6  probably  the worst engine ever   as it s often sited  i bought this car from one of my father s coworkers  but this car was very well taken care of  not a speck of rust was to be found  the interior looked as if no human had graced its presence  all maintenance records were in order and detailed  this car was supposed to last me until i landed my first job  and then some  but it didn t  granted  the car ran flawlessly for the first six months i owned it  but then it began to turn against me  the radiator went ka boom in the middle of boston  the air conditioner was so powerful it turned the car off  if i was going up a hill  in winter  i had to turn off the radio  heater  and rear window defroster to have enough power to climb the hill  it was an under whelming car the car soon began to die a quick death and that s when i was on the lookout for another car  again  another of my father s coworkers decided to assist me in my quest for reliable transportation  ha  anyway  this friend had another friend who had a saab for sale  and for the sake of story  let s just say that this friend of a friend was shifty the saab was kept at this friend of a friend s work  a sunoco station where he was a mechanic  he showed me to the car  it was covered in  clever  bumper stickers and there appeared to be a young tree growing through the engine bay  but i was hopeful  sanguine  i took the key from his meaty hands and turned the ignition  the car grumbled to life right away  i shifted into first gear and drove around the gas station  a very thorough test drive we told him we would take it  the cost was  900 the mechanic who owned the saab said he just had to find the title at his house and that he would pass it along to my father s friend who in turn would pass it along to my father who would hopefully pass it along to me one month later i received the title  it was a little suspicious  the name signed on the back was not the mechanic s name  but a woman s name  and then there was the date  the date was off by 10 months  dated 10 months earlier  what happened  was there some sort of shift in the space time continuum that i was not aware of i brought the title over to my insurance agent and she looked the title over and said   well  the registry probably won t even notice  in fact  if they do  they will just assume she s old okay b the bad saab mechanic in newburyport  ma  he was a bad man  a real bad man  here s my little story  my car wouldn t start  or more accurately  it started but intermittently  as my spider sense tingled i determined that this was a problem  so  i drove down to my trusty local mechanic and relayed to him the problem at hand a few hours later i received a phone call from the very same mechanic  my mechanic  he stated that he didn t really know what was wrong with the car  he confessed to me  although i am not a priest and he is not catholic but muslim  that he didn t work much on saabs but that he had the name of a very good saab mechanic as soon as he revealed to me the name of this saab master mechanic i called and told this swedish automotive sage my story  after concluding the phone call i was on my way to newburyport  almost 13 miles from my house two days later the saab master mechanic called my home to tell me the car was ready  after much excitement and washing of hands  i asked my father for a ride to the garage to collect my car  little did i know what was in store we arrived at the garage a short time later and the saab master mechanic greeted us warmly  he grabbed the keys to my car and showed me what i had hoped for  the car started  right away  the first try  victory was mine then the bill came what the problem was with the bill was not the price  it was actually low  especially for a saab  but there was an extra item added into the grand total that called my attention  a towing charge b a very short play  me what s this towing charge  i drove the car here saab master mechanic well  i often drive home the cars i m working on  and your car died in my driveway  and i had to have it towed me you re charging me for your tow saab master mechanic yup me but i told you the car was having trouble starting  why would you drive it home saab master mechanic it s how i work me but that doesn t seem fair saab master mechanic alright  you don t have to pay the towing charge  and if you don t  you can never bring the car back here again at this point my father interrupted and said   okay  fine  here  and paid for my towing charge  i never went back to the saab master mechanic  on the way home i stopped by my regular mechanic and i told him   look  i don t care if you have to work from a book  i m not going back to that saab guy  i then told my mechanic what had happened at the saab guy  my mechanic apologized for the unpleasantness i experienced and said he would do his best with my saab  what a guy  and boy  did he make some major mistakes b radiator  starter  alternator  battery  fuel pump  and breaks  unknown to me at the time  my newly purchased saab had been dormant for quite some time  dormancy is just about the worst one can do to a car  parts  major and expensive parts  corrode and deteriorate  i drove my saab for approximately one month before it turned against me  several times first  the radiator went  no problem  i got a used one off dad s co worker and dad installed it  thanks daddy  the starter was next  which was misdiagnosed by my mechanic  and i ended up with a new alternator  then the starter was replaced  but this was undermined by the fact that the battery was now dead  off to the sears auto center i go  die hards  please  now the car could produce and use electricity  another attack on my bank account quickly followed as a faulty fuel pump  the one in the gas tank saabs have two fuel pumps  choked my car into submission and left me stranded at work on a cold new england winter night  daddy b final tips and good things about saabs  50 50 reliability  saabs either last forever or fall apart  that s just the way it is  of course  people of higher incomes will have a much better time with their saabs since they can afford the high maintenance bills if you re buying used  make sure that the car was well maintained  of course  this goes for any car  but with saabs it s especially true saabs don t rust easily you too can often put high mileage on a saab  i ve seen saabs with well over 300 000 miles on their odometers  and they weren t even being being towed join a saab club and learn to do some repairs on your own  you can get factory parts for cheap  real cheap  this will save you money  lots of money comfy seats  it s like driving around in your living room  if your living room is very small and encased in sheet metal the engine doesn t leak  despite the fact that my car had all these aforementioned mechanical problems  the engine itself was always reliable and never leaked spacious engine bay for you to work in  if you like doing that sort of thing  i tried to install spark plugs once and didn t tag the spark plug wires and reinstalled them into the wrong positions  that was a rough start dipsticks for everything  even manual transmission fluid  large funnel like caps  so it s easy to add fluids b postscript  i taught my girlfriend at the time how to drive stick in this dear old saab of mine  we went to school together  and after the spring semester was over  she went home to maine  i drove my saab up to maine every other weekend to see her halfway through the summer  i received a  letter  from her and it was not  good news  she announced that she had gotten a new haircut and was now a new woman  and i was history  yup the saab soon bankrupted me  new breaks   700  and i had to sell it  my parents had been assisting me financially for the upkeep of this car  but i felt bad that it was costing so much money  i sold the saab to another of my father s coworkers for  500  he belonged to a saab club and he got the car running fine and dandy  he discovered that the fuel pump in the engine needed to be replaced  cost   25 damn it  ,scab number doors door transmission speed

208,auto, it was always my dream to own a hummer  i wanted it so bad ever since i was a kid  and recently i finally got one  it s difficult to own and maintenance  but is well worth it features pros huge tires  these tires are bigger than my 7 year old son  they are huge and well worth it  even though a set ends up costing over  500  its well worth it  when i took this beast up to the mountains  i was amazed at the stuff it could do  it was driving over 5 foot rocks like there was nothing there  this thing was driving through 4 feet of water with ease like it would on the road  it is definately a vehicle for the offroad  no wonder they use them in the army  tough  you can t imagine how tough these things are  i smacked into a tree head on at 70 mph and there was barely a scratch on it  i mean just imagine if that was a car  sure the other people wouldn t be lucky to hit you  but you are almost garunteed survival  with the hge tires  you d probably end up running them over like that 5 foot rock  it s just about the safest little beast you can ride  it s very intimidating to see this monterous beast driving up to you with its huge form  it has a the same width of an 18 wheeler and almost as tall  nobody ll get in your way with this thing fame  whenever i go anywhere with my hummer  even just a small trip to the grocery store  there is almost always somebody there to ask about my hummer  it ll make you feel like you re a star  when somebody comes up and asks questions and says that they wish they had a hummer  if you don t like being popular  don tget a hummer  but who wouldn t love the envy of others  surprisingly quiet  i once rode in a 1992 hummer at my uncles house as a child  and i remembered the huge car  huge tires  and huge sound  it was like driving one of those old submarines where you go deaf after two hours  the radio had to be up all the way just to hear it  but now  somehow they kept that same ominous look and feel  without that apocalyptic sound  you can take a nice quiet drive down the road at night without waking up the whole neigborhood  2 000 pund winch  there is an option to get a 2 000 pound winch and i would suggest getting it  now you can put your hummer to work  drag entire trees into your campsite and other things on that subject  i once tried to use my hummer for water skiiing in a small lake  i don t suggest this  but still  it s great to have it  you can do alkmost anything with the hummer if you get this cons gas guzzler  as much as i wanted a hummer as a child  i did research and found out what it was really like  it gets horriblegas mileage and uses hard to find deisel  they give you a huge tank for a reason  you can hold about 45 gallons in the primary and auxillary tanks  so it is well eqipped to last about 500 1000 miles  it s much better on the highway because you can control the road with the fear of others and you don t have to slow down often  and in the woods its a powerhouse  but i would neer use my hummer to commute  i made a pact with myself never to own a regualar car  so i drive a saturn vue most places  it gets good gas mileage  but that s off the subject  don t get the hummer as your primary vehicle  because you ll be spending hundreds on gas  every week or so  i do take my hummer to work just to show it off  but it s just not healthy to take it every day sluggish steering  i found it to have some slow steering to no surprise  i have gotten used to it but in the beginning  i couldn t take it anywhere  it really is a bit difficult to go most places until you get used to the way it works and it is not fun when you re waiting  but it is well worth it because once you get used to it  it s a huge  mean  fighting machine space  it takes up a lot of space  i can t fit it in my garage  but it doesn t get dirty in the rain  and you can t park it at those parking garges with height limits most of the time  and sometimes you have to hang out of the wondow to pick up your food at the drive through  but the size pays off  if you re going to meet someone  they can t miss a huge green hummer  and it strikes fear on the hearts of millions  but the size does limit it places to go  another reason i prefer my vue  ,always dream summer want bad ever since kid recently finally get one difficult maintenance well worth feature pro huge tire tire bigger year old son huge well

209,camera, i had been wanting a digital camera  researching all the sites  reading reviews  and had decided on the casio exilim series  the old advantix died in may  so  my camera purchase was forced  i ordered the exilim z3 from cdw in may 2003  but  after waiting 4 weeks with no known due date  i cancelled the order  i started looking elsewhere and couldn t find this camera anywhere  i contacted casio for help  they told me to try radio shack  i couldn t image they would have such a high tech toy as i hadn t been in a radio shack for years  was i shocked  i took my boss with me  of who was also going to buy one  our local radio shack had one  so  he called around  there was no radio shack within a 3 hour radius that had one  they were all sold out  radio shack had a promotion with which i received a free carrying case  static lcd screen protectors and a cleaning kit  this seems to be a hot item to say the least this camera is great  it has a best shot feature that sets the exposure  white balance  focus  etc  for you based on what you are taking photos of  this best shot feature shows you a sample picture of these settings and describes what the setting does  there are 21 preset settings and you have the option to make your own  i use sunset  portrait  and portrait with scenery most often  it is really easy to use  it will also allow you to set these items yourself  which i m sure the pros would love  another interesting setting is the white balance  on auto  the camera compensates well  however  i have found the under fluorescent lighting  you need to set white balance to fluorescent  there are six settings  auto  full sun  shade  incandescent  fluorescent  and manual the camera also allows you to take 30 second live video with sound  the sound is pretty good as long as there is no wind to ruffle the sound  the video is better than video i have seen on a lot of cameras the camera has 3x optical zoom and 9x digital zoom  giving you a total of 12x zoom  i have windows xp on my computer  so  when i hooked the base up to my usb port  xp immediately recognized it  installed the drivers and asked me what i wanted to do  you can browse the file system on the camera as it is docked just like it was another hard drive  i didn t need to install any software and transferring the pictures is as simple as copying and pasting i contacted support once more to be sure there were no issues with the 128mb sd memory card  i contacted them via e mail and i had an answer in two hours  you get a  real  person at customer service  you get their  personal  e mail address  and they are really friendly with the 128mb sd memory card i can take the following 31   30 second videos 68   2048x1536 fine pictures 105   1600x1200 fine pictures 163   1280x960 fine pictures 584   640x480 fine pictures 767   640x480 normal pictures 1227   640x480 economy pictures each quality setting allows for any resolution  i just didn t list all of them here i have yet to run the battery dead  after a week at the beach and around 300 pictures videos  so  i m not sure of the available battery time the time between shots is around 2 seconds and the time between actually pushing the record button and getting the picture can sometimes lag around a second  it really seems to depend on the situation  which i assume is related to auto focus  however  this is still much better than our advantix was so  no complaints here on that subject there are several features that we still haven t played with and after downloading the pdf for full documentation  we still haven t read through all 100  pages two features we find to be the coolest are  on screen cropping of photos  and the 3x timer feature  the on screen cropping feature will allow you to center shots  the 3x timer feature will take the first photo after 10 seconds  the second photo after 1 second  and then the last photo after another 1 second  this proved very good for the latest family picture of 38 people  the last picture being the best the red eye reduction feature is also interesting in that upon snapping the picture the camera flashes several times  so  if the cool camera wasn t drawing enough attention the flash sure will  the most common comments   147what was that 148   147can i see it 148   147how does that zoom work 148  ,want digital camera search sit read review decide case

210,camera, don t get me wrong  the canon elph s200 is an awesome camera  it s super compact  it takes great photos  clear up to an 8x10  it s simple to use  it takes decent mpegs  and it looks way cool this is the perfect camera for anyone taking simple snapshots of friends and family  i bought this before my first child was born so that i had a digital camera during labor and delivery and could send out those first pictures of the baby over the internet with a quickness  it worked out great  the pictures were very clear  even in low light  i m not sure why there are complaints on the flash quality  we had absolutely no problems in that area  even when i couldn t see the baby on the lcd screen because the room was too dark  the flash was definitely bright enough to take a great picture i also love that it uses the compact flash card rather than a smart card  since more and more things are using a flash card rather than the smart media  i am able to swap my ipaq s card with my elph s and always have a spare the battery life has also not been an issue for us  as you can imagine  being new parents we take tons of pictures  i typically take about ten pictures a day and maybe three movies a week  i do not charge my battery more than once a week  if that  so  in other words  the battery lasts for quite some time  i also love the fact that the battery is rechargeable  and it does quickly recharge  about an hour and a half after the first charge  because we would be going through a million batteries otherwise the camera is also sturdy and durable  i take this camera with me every where and it usually travels by diaper bag so it gets thrashed around quite a bit  it also has gotten occasionally  misted  or gotten some baby finger goop on it  but it cleans up like a champ and i have not had one problem with it working improperly or being damaged i have a few complaints about the camera   i wish the zoom was better  i know that the digital zoom can get right up close  but you lose so much resolution when you print that i never go past the 2 0 optical zoom  usually  that s close enough  but now that my little one is walking  it is hard to get a nice  close up shot when he s across the room  there is lens adapter so no additional lenses can be attached  there is no battery life indicator  this makes it difficult to determine when the battery needs charging  until it gets too late  i wish it came with a carrying case  canon offers a camera case specifically for the elph  but from what i can remember  they were a bit pricey  we opted for getting a generic holder  which works great  but it would have been nice if it came with the package when we bought the camera the shutterlag can get a bit annoying  if you always push the shutter halfway down so that the camera has ample time to focus and what not  then the shutter  obviously  won t lag  but if you want to take a quick photo to capture that perfect moment  you may just miss it because the camera took too long to do its business  this is not terribly pronounced  but it does happen  the 16mb compact flash card is a joke  considering how inexpensive flash cards have become  you would think canon would spring for a 128 or something  i really do like this camera  it certainly serves its purpose at the moment  eventually it will be traded in for a camera that accepts additional lenses and  of course  has more megapixels  ,get wrong canon awesome camera super compact take great photo clear simple use take decent peg look way cool perfect camera anyone take simple snapshots friends family buy first child bear digital camera labor delivery could send first picture baby internet quickness work great picture clear even low light sure complaints flash quality absolutely problems area even see baby lead screen room dark flash definitely bright enough take great picture also love use compact flash card rather smart card since things use flash card rather smart media able swap pay card always spare battery life also issue us imagine new parent take tons picture typically take ten picture day maybe three move week charge battery week word battery last quite time also love fact battery rechargeable quickly charge hour half first charge would go million batteries otherwise camera also sturdy unable take camera every usually travel dinner bag get thrash around quite bite also get occasionally miss get baby finger good clean like champ one problem work improperly damage complaints camera wish room better know digital room get right close lose much resolution print never go past optical room usually close enough little one walk hard get nice close shoot across room lens adapt additional lenses attach battery life indicator make difficult determine battery need charge get late wish come carry case canon offer camera case specifically remember bite price often get genetic holder work great would nice come package buy camera shutterlag get bite annoy always push shutter halfway camera ample time focus shutter obviously law want take quick photo capture perfect moment may miss camera take long business terribly pronounce happen mb compact flash card joke consider expensive flash card become would think canon would spring something really like camera certainly serve purpose moment eventually trade camera accept additional lenses course megapixels
211,auto, i bought this car for its great looks and reliability  honestly  i m a  quot made in america quot  kind of guy  and i started out looking at the domestics  but in the end i chose what i thought to be the better car  my opinion  of course  besides  there s just something about those sexy quad headlamps love  this car is just plain fun to drive  pretty impressive acceleration for a 4 cylinder  especially in 3rd gear around 38mph  great handling  very comfortable seats hate  i don t hate anything about the car  there really isn t much room in the back seat  but if i cared about a back seat  i wouldn t have gotten a sport coupe  one problem i do have is with changing the oil filter  it s difficult to reach unless you access it from underneath  i alternate between changing the oil myself and taking it to the garage where they use a bay  in other words  i only change the filter every other oil change  which is fine although it s too soon to rave about reliability  car is only 1 year old  honda has a great track record  so i m expecting great things from this car  i would recommend this car to anyone looking for a sporty  reliable  great looking car  i would probably not recommend this car to anyone over 6 2 quot  i am not quite 6 2 quot  and i keep my front seat all the way back and slightly declined  it s comfortable for me to drive this way  but for any taller drivers who prefer to sit closer to the wheel  this might not be your car  one last note  on the edmund s website i read several posts where drivers complained of the road noise from inside the car  i ve never had any problem with road noise  even on several different types of roads happy driving br br  ,buy car great look reliability honestly quit make america quit kind guy start look domestics end choose think better car opinion course besides something sex quand headlamps love car plain fun drive pretty impressive acceleration cylinder especially rd gear around may great handle comfortable seat hate hate anything car really much room back seat care back seat get sport couple one problem change oil filter difficult reach unless access underneath alternate change oil take garage use bay word change filter every oil change fine although soon reliability car year old hand great track record expect great things car would recommend car anyone look sport reliable great look car would probably recommend car anyone quit quite quit keep front seat way back slightly decline comfortable drive way taller drivers prefer sit closer wheel might car one last note edmund webster read several post drivers complain road noise inside car never problem road noise even several different type roads happy drive br
212,auto, i just brought a sante fe about 6 months ago and i am impressed by a lot of features about it  1  a very smooth and quiet ride  the suspension system is great and the noise level from outside is very low while you are driving  when the windows are up  it handles the road very well  it gets through the snow well but don t expect it to handle like the bigger utility vehicles  it can handle a little more snow than the average car  it does have a 4 wheel drive system 2  very roomy  you can fold down back seats and have plenty of storage space in the trunk  it sits about 5 people comfortably  plenty of cup holders for the drive in or long trips 3  a nice sound system  the cd player  radio and speaker system are great  good quality sound 4 good price and a great warranty  it prices below  20 000 and came with a 100 000 mile warranty 5  good looking body style will get you noticed on the road  it also has luggage carrying straps on top of vehicle  it is about average on gas consumption all in all a great deal for the bargain conscious consumer in my opinion  ,bring santa fe months ago impress lot feature smooth quiet ride suspension system great noise level outside low drive windows candle road well get snow well expect handle like bigger utility vehicles handle little snow average car wheel drive system room fold back seat plenty storage space trunk sit people comfortably plenty cup holders drive long trip nice sound system player radio speaker system great good quality sound good price great warranty price come mile warranty good look body style get notice road also luggage carry strap top vehicle average gas consumption great deal bargain conscious consumer opinion
213,camera, many users like floppies because they re familiar and offer a cable free pc interface  which is uncommon in digital cameras  but floppy disks provide limited storage space and require an unacceptably long delay while an image is saved  although the mavica mvc fd90 writes images to floppies four times faster than pc floppy drives  it still makes you wait 10 seconds between shots  you might capture your child s first step  but you ll miss the second and third ones  you have to wait about 6 seconds for the camera to power on before you can take a shot one of the camera s biggest advantages is long battery life  and the lcd displays the minutes of charge time remaining  but you can t change the batteries while the mavica mvc fd90 is mounted on a tripod  that s unfortunate because the camera is unwieldy and hard to position handheld for image composition with the lcd  even though the screen is large and bright  the camera s user interface is a little confusing at first  but once you ve run through the features a few times  the clearly marked controls and menus make it easy to operate br br  ,many users like flop familiar offer cable free pp interface uncommon digital camera floppy disk provide limit storage space require unacceptable long delay image save although mavra mac ff write image flop four time faster pp floppy drive still make wait second shots might capture child first step miss second third ones wait second camera power take shoot one camera biggest advantage long battery life lead display minutes charge time remain change batteries mavra mac ff mount try unfortunate camera unwieldy hard position hand image composition lead even though screen large bright camera user interface little confuse first run feature time clearly mark control venus make easy operate br
214,camera, i can characterize myself as a buyer that adapts to the tool s shortcomings rather than one that makes the ideal purchase no matter the price  however  in this case this camera has exceeded my demands  my original reason for purchasing this model was the desire for a digital camera with a higher megapixel count and that was affordable relatively speaking and this model has been discounted heavily with the introduction of the sony f717 b  pros   lets begin with the unique body design  i tend to enjoy going to local events because with the current mob mentality in los angeles one never knows when a riot is about to breakout  anyways being a person of medium stature this design is great for getting a well focused overhead shot  i end up turning the camera upside down so that i can view the lcd screen and the other hand is free to operate the zoom lens button on the lens no having to fumble around on the camera body for the zoom lens feature  also for low angle shots this camera proves ideal i don t try many because in los angeles this prone position is a candidate for an appearance on america s most wanted  not to mention that the automatic focusing is extremely fast so that one can get that live action shot of the mugger or muggee since getting this camera i ve reverted back to actually shooting more in shutter priority mode  with most lesser brands of digital cameras the settings were either very limited  nikon 880  or the fact that you had to perform numerous adjustments to get the proper exposure  with the sony this feature is done with a easily reachable knob near the shutter release that also control aperture settings  why you ask would anyone care for the fact that capturing action shots i wanted that freeze frame look and didn t always trust the camera settings  besides with the large f2 0 aperture this allows more choices than the typical other slower lenses found on lesser priced cameras  i like the fact that features such as the zoom lens capability  white balance exposure  ae lock are placed on the zoom instead of the camera body due to the fact that i don t have to stop concentrating on the subject and bring down the camera to toggle a button or possibly jam another finger between my head and camera body to make an adjustment    cons   i do have issue with the electronic view finder because after the shutter is depressed it doesn t follow the action but then the cameras buffer doesn t allow rapid single shots  but there is a continuous setting  everybody complains about the proprietary accessories  but there is a growing aftermarket of fairly priced accessories that work as well as the sony brand b  recommendation   if you are a photo enthusiast looking for a unique camera that has the following strengths  ability to handle every angle of coverage  large aperture setting  f2 0  for lowlight and action shots  major controls placed on the lens barrel zoom  white balance  ae lock  allowing one to better focus on the subject consider this camera as to whether the sony f717 is worth spending the extra money on unless one needs the higher iso  or faster shutter speed  or the hotshoe mount which are cosmetic and not revolutionary when compared to the f707  ,characterize buyer adapt tool shortcomings rather one make ideal purchase matter price however case camera exceed demand original reason

216,camera, if you read my s200 review  you know how i got the s330 camera  my brother got a good deal on this camera at dell com with 10  off and a stackable  25 off  250 coupon  the final price came out to  324 with free shipping and no sales tax  the camera s mrsp is  499 but you will find it on store shelves and web sites for  399 and under b the short take  the s330 is the 2002 update to the powershot s300 camera that was fairly popular  although i believe it was not as popular as the s110 last year  the s300 was a solid performer that offered more user features than the more basic s110  the s330 improves the camera here and there and adds a few new twists to the design and function  for the most part  the s330 seems to be a tweaked version of the s300 model the similarities of the s330 to s300 start with both being 2 megapixel camera with 3x optical zoom and 2 5x digital zoom  the basic camera size is about the same but still slightly larger than the s110 s200 digital elph  the s330 retains all the features of the s300 with alot of tweaking done by canon  just a few new features make its appearance on the s330 just like on the s200  also debuting is the enhanced lithium ion battery for the s330 s200 models  the nb 1lh battery the main perceived weaknesses of this camera are the short battery life despite the improved battery  2 megapixel capacity  and a perceivable size difference from the s110 s200 model  despite having just slightly larger numbers in dimensions and weight  the s330 feels like a much different and heavier beast than the light and tiny s110 despite what the numbers say again  the main competition here seems to be canon powershot s200 and minolta dimagex  however  because of the larger camera size  other competitors include the nikon coolpix 2500  775  885  canon s30  s40  several olympus and fuji models as well  the s300 is smaller than most of the camera listed above with the exceptions of the s200  the dimagex  and perhaps the coolpix 2500 overall  the s330 is a worthy successor to the s300 but doesn t warrant an upgrade from the s300  it is a solid take anywhere camera that provides a bit more manual controls if you so desire it b i pros i b 1  fairly compact size 2  2 megapixel camera 3  3x optical zoom 4  compactflash media 5  movie record  limited 6  multiple on camera photo effects 7  direct printing to specific canon printers like 820d  dpof   digital print order format 8  aiaf system  artificial intelligence autofocus 9  adjustable iso settings 10  self timer 11  stainless steel case 12  accepts batteries from s110 s300 model elph b i cons b i 1  size difference looks and feels substantial to s110 s200 camera 2  only 2 megapixel camera 3  short battery life despite enhanced lithium ion batteries 4  expensive batteries 5  weak flash 6  edge mount for tripods b detail time  if you ve seen the s200  then there isn t alot of difference between the two in overall styling  the s330 has a couple more buttons and an external speaker as well  the s330 is similarly styled like the s300 the s330 s dimensions are 3 7 x 2 5 x 1 3 inches with a weight of 9 7 oz  with compactflash card and battery installed  compared to the s200 s dimensions 3 4 x 2 2 x 1 1 inches and weight of 6 6 oz  before cf card and battery  7 7 oz  with cf card and battery  it seems like a scant 0 2 inches in each dimension and a slight weight difference of 2 oz  well  that s a 25  difference in weight and the slight difference in dimensions adds up to a camera that looks and feels much bigger and heavier than the s200 camera  the unit is 0 1 inches thicker but a tad lighter than the s300 unit  those of you who are interested in portability should line the s200 and s330 next to each other at the store  the difference is extremely noticable like the s200  the body is made out of a high impact polycarbonate casing with a stainless steel plating  this change in body design may one of the reasons the s330 is significantly cheaper than the s300 model  a 1 5 inch color lcd with anti reflective coating graces the back of the camera with the same 8 large button layout as the s200  all buttons are easy to press and the user interface is also much easier to use  the s330 retains the retracting lens that slows up turning on and off the camera  the lens is automatically covered when the lens is fully retracted the 1 5 inch 1 18 megapixel color lcd that has existed since the first digital elph was released still displays your photos in fine detail and color  it is fairly easily seen in bright sunlight  and it displays even more information that the previous digital elph models before it  information such as iso settings  file size compression settings  flash settings  your shooting mode  metering  resolution type  macros  and even a histogram for tonal distribution  which i really don t know what to do with yet  but i ll learn it soon enough  photos taken using the lcd screen are just about the photos you are recording to file  95  accuracy  since the optical viewfinder is less accurate  85  by some reviews  i find that the lcd shows most of the picture you are taking versus the optical viewfinder b it s all about the pictures  the s330 does a commendable job taking shots for 4x6  5x7  and even gives acceptable 8x10 photos  my canon powershot s40 gave equivalent photos at the 4x6 and 5x7 size  enlarging the shots beyond the 5x7 size is where most 3 and 4 megapixel camera show their superiority  under the best of conditions  8x10 photos are rather decent with some loss of detail and slight pixelation which is more than you can say for some 2 megapixel cameras and even some 3 megapixel cameras   my experience has been with mostly canons  nikons  and a few olympus cameras  the 3x optical zoom is great since the digital zoom is fairly unreliable  as it is for most digital cameras  in maintaining picture details color reproduction has only gotten better in the s330 over the s110 and s300 elphs  the s330 shots look a little more natural to me than the s110 s300 models  details in photos are sharp and the automatic exposure controls do a great job in a wide range of lighting conditions  the aiaf system does a good job in low light conditions although the flash is a bit weak beyond 8 10 feet from the camera  nighttime conditions  the aiaf system works by using three points of reference on the camera to set the focus of the camera  allowing you to take shots with clear and good contrast with little effort on your part   note that the aiaf system existed in the s300 model as well the s330 performs extremely well as a simple  point and shoot  camera b the outer look of the s330  in some ways  the camera looks like a larger version of the s200  the s330 keeps to the overall stylings of the digital elph cameras  the camera has a stainless steel exterior that feels extremely smooth for the most part and smudges with fingerprints rather easily  especially the chromed finished areas of the camera  the front face has a slightly raised  ridged area housing the lens  optical viewfinder  and aiaf lamp  the diminutive flash sits at the upper right corner  when looking straight at the camera  the top panel of the camera houses the microphone  shutter  on off button  and dial for shooting mode  the dial could be set from automatic shoot mode  manual shoot mode  stitch assist  movie  and browse mode  the on off button required that you press it down for 1 2 secs to turn on the camera but a single press to shut it off  the right panel of the camera  looking at the back of the camera  houses the cover for the type i cf slot and the wrist strap attachment  the left panel houses the a v connection and usb connector covered by an attached rubber cover  the bottom panel has the battery cover and the tripod mount which lies at the far left side of the camera  unfortunately the back of the camera houses the 1 5 inch lcd  4 large buttons beneath the lcd which are the set  menu  display  and exposure compensation white balance photo effects buttons  a slightly raised circular section to the right of the lcd that acts as a 4 way direction pad for the menus and as secondary buttons for features like spot metering  macro infinity  flash  and continuous self timer mode  there is a thumb rest indentation under the mode dial and right of that is the cf cover latch  the upper left corner of the back of the s330 is the opening for the external speaker and the optical viewfinder to the left of that  the upper right corner has two buttons for zooming in and out  most of the buttons  except the two leftmost buttons under the lcd  are within reach of your thumb  by the way  i use medium sized gloves b battery life  the overall battery life is a bit better than the s300 although not by much  with the display turned on and all the automatic features enabled  you might get 150 180 shots per fully charged battery  however  if you have the lcd display turned off  you can take nearly 450 shots  using the older nb 1l battery cuts the numbers down by nearly 30  so you get 100 120 shots with the lcd on and 300 320 shots with the lcd off  too bad the newer nb 1lh battery runs at least  50 and usually in the  70 80 range  if you can find it b some features and file size issues  some new features to the s330 include an orientation sensor so that the camera will automatically rotate the photo into the proper viewing position  support for the cp 10  cp 100  and 820d canon photo printers  the  my camera  options   long shutter  mode  for low  dim  and nighttime lighting shots  enhanced white balancing selections  option between 2 and 10 second self timer  sound playback on the camera itself  exposure flash exposure autofocus lock modes  spot metering  manual iso settings from 50 400  and enhanced selection of photo effects directly on camera the  my camera  mode changes simple things like sounds the camrea makes when being turned on as well as backgrounds for menus  two default settings are included with room for one more  you can upload sounds and backgrounds through the zoombrowser software included in the package the continuous shoot mode is actually much faster with the lcd off  with the lcd on you get a slow shot per second rate  but this rate at least doubles with the lcd completely off  the rate with lcd off approaches 3 shots per sec on certain resolutions compared to 1 5 1 8 shots per second with the lcd on  the continuous shoot mode allows the user to take several consecutive photos when holding down the shutter button  you can turn off the aiaf system which gives you a single center autofocus point  this does speed up the amount of time it takes to capture photos  the digital zoom can also be turned off as well  the af assist beam can also be turned off  although i wouldn t recommend it in low night and nighttime shooting  you can also set the long shutter setting in manual shoot mode from 1 to 15 seconds long resolutions range from large  1600x1200  medium  1024x768  and small  640x480  compression ranges from super fine  largest file setting  fine  and normal  smallest file setting  an average large super fine photo takes around 1 mb of memory  this gets a bit larger with more complex pictures movie mode is quite limited for the s330  you can get 640x480 resolution at 20 frames per second  fps  for a total of 4 secs  320x240 resolution at 20 fps for a total of 10 seconds  and 160x120 resoltuion at 20 fps for a total of 30 seconds  the total file size of the movie cannot exceed 4 mb and is stored only in avi format  i haven t found the movie mode very useful so far b what s in the package  canon has always included excellent manuals and documentation for the camera and software included in all their camera packages  the s330 is no different  a good sized camera and software manual is included detailing basic and advanced functions for the camera  a wrist strap is included in the package as well as an updated lithium ion battery compared to the s110 s300  the battery has the same size and shape as the nb 1l found in the s110 and s300 cameras but is now dubbed the nb 1lh and carries 840 mah versus the nb 1l s 680 mah charge  the same battery charger is also included in the package  you can use the older nb 1l batteries in the s330 but expect a much shorter battery life  you also get a measley 8 mb cf card  so you need to purchase a bigger one  at least 128mb in my opinion  two cds are included with the software for the camera  i use adobe photoshop 6 right now  so i didn t try the included software i would definitely recommend buying a larger cf card  an additional battery  and a small camera carry case  remember that you cannot use type ii cf media  like the ibm microdrive  so your best bet is 128 or 256 mb cf cards  if you really want 1 2 gb and 1 gb cf cards  be forewarned that the price runs in the  400 range for a 512 mb  1 2 gb  cf card and at least  700 for a 1 gb cf card at the time i write this  you should not need more than a 256mb cf card in my opinion  the ac adapter kit might be helpful too although not necessary  but if you plan on printing directly from the camera to the supported canon printers  i would get the ac adapter  i would highly consider at least a seperate cf reader so you don t have to drain the batteries on the camera transferring images to the computer   you want more details  check out these additional sites b www imaging resource com www dpreview com both sides provide detailed looks at the camera that they review and explain features and quality of photos in severe detail  if you can t find the information you re looking for at either of these two sites  i doubt you would find it anywhere b about me and photography and the fate of the camera  i m not a photography student or even an enthusiast  i m a physician that enjoy technology and gadgets  i know the kind of quality and features i want in a camera  although i have several camera lying around the house  these camera include a canon s40  nikon coolpix 5000  canon s330  nikon coolpix 995  i just know that the quality of the pictures of s200 camera are pleasing to my eye and impress friends when i show them the photos taken by the s200 on a computer screen or developed through sites like ofoto  if you read my s200 review  then you know i first bought that camera  it was taken by my girlfriend and i got back my s110  then my brother traded his s330 for my s110  so now i have the s330 in my possession and now you re reading my review  my girlfriend enjoys the size and flexibility of the s200  my brother enjoys the size and more rugged construction of the s110  yes  i still feel that the s110 is more solidly constructed than the s200 and s330 cameras and it feels heavier than the s200  i like the s330 because it has a 3x optical zoom and a more robust feature set than the s200 camera

217,camera, the popularity of the canon powershot g2 has had tongues wagging for many months  if only canon would offer the advanced features and pro level performance of the g2 in a package that was like the super compact s110 and s300  oh  and at a bargain price too  then all would be right in the digital camera world  well  canon has done exactly what everyone has been clamoring for  the new canon powershot s40 offers almost all the advanced features available on the groundbreaking g2  compact size  almost as small as the powershot s300  and a bargain price  the s40 is a feature rich four megapixel digital camera that offers advanced amateurs and pro photographers a compact digital imaging machine that provides more features and creative options than most photographers will ever use   a few words about digital photography vs traditional film photography  contrary to popular belief digital photography and traditional film photography remain two separate and distinct mediums  digital photography is not going to replace traditional film photography any time in the foreseeable future  both mediums have their strengths and their weaknesses and smart photographers will dismiss the hype and hyperbole and utilize each medium to its maximum capability for the applications it is best suited for  digital photography is very convenient and it is possible to shoot digital images and utilize them only moments later  something that cannot be done with traditional 35mm film which must be processed first  digital images  with the use of image manipulation programs like adobephotoshop  are capable of much more manipulation than traditional film images  reality need not be a limiting factor for the digital photographer  who has the ability to create not only images that have never existed before  but also images that  in reality  could not possibly exist  what digital photography cannot do is show the nuances in contrast  depth of field effect  edge sharpness  bokeh  and color tonal dynamic range that traditional  especially slow slide and fine grain b w  film is capable of  the current crop of high resolution four and five megapixel digital cameras offer photographers more options than ever before  good 11x14 enlargements of uncompressed digital image files are possible for the first time with consumer level digital cameras  make no mistake digital 11x14 s will not outshine 11x14 enlargements made with slow speed slide  or fine grain b w  film  especially if they are viewed with a good quality 4x 6x loupe  slow speed slide and fine grain b w film will produce acceptable to good 16x20 enlargements  something that is not possible with digital image files at this time unless they are custom printed be careful that you don t fall into the digital photography is cheaper trap  because that argument doesn t hold any water  digital cameras can cost from 3 to 10 times as much as a similar film camera  here s an example  the nikon n65 film slr runs about  300 and the fuji finepix s1 pro digital slr  which actually has fewer features  runs about  2300  cf sm memory stick ibm microdrive storage media  the  film  for digital cameras  can add from  50 to  500 to the price of your digital camera  depending on capacity  film cameras last longer and the technology moves much more slowly  whatever digital camera you buy today is already two generations behind the cutting edge  manufacturers are in the final r d stages with the next digital camera and they are simultaneously working on the development of the successor to that model  and even more troubling are serious concerns about digital print longevity and technological obsolescence rendering digital image files un retrievable in the future b do you really need a 4 or 5 megapixel digital camera b probably not  unless you are a serious amateur photographer or a professional  if you ve been using a pro 35mm slr and pro quality zoom or prime  fixed focal length  lenses and shooting slow slide or fine grain b w film  then you are probably going to need a four or five megapixel digital to give you image quality that is comparable to what you are used to  if you ve been shooting with 35mm amateur slr s  consumer level zooms  and color print film  then you are probably going to love digital photography  and if you shoot primarily snapshots  family  friends  life events  vacation  then you probably won t need anything more than a very good 2 megapixel  or if you occasionally want 8x10 enlargements  a good 3 megapixel  point and shoot  digital camera b features  i exposure  the

the weather here in kentucky has been pretty typical for this time of year with warm pretty days followed by cold gray rainy days  my friend  who sells and distributes photographic equipment  showed up the saturday before st  patrick s day with a brand new s40 and asked if i wanted come out and play  my friend thought the compact stainless steel s40 body looked very cool and the sliding lens cover reminded him of the classic wwii minox spy camera  we tested the s40 over the course of the st  patrick s day weekend  which was cold  gray  and rainy not optimal camera testing weather  we first set up a macro stage  children  you can try this at home for directions see my review of the olympus e 20n digital camera the url is listed below  and spread out a collection of brightly colored plastic beach toys  on a white background  that we use to test digital camera color  after manually white balancing the camera we used the s40 to shoot brightly colored red  green  blue  and yellow plastic shapes  the s40 s colors were well saturated and accurate  the camera s white balance handled the test lighting pretty well  though we both noticed a very slight warm cast with the auto setting  the manual white balance setting produced the best results  the s40 had some difficulty with incandescent  yellow  lighting  without flash  but when used with the flash the incandescent setting achieved nearly neutral results in the close range  the s40 s white balance worked better than most of the current digital cameras available under artificial lighting  the s40 s performance in this test was virtually identical to the tests we had done with the canon g2  the powershot s40 takes about four seconds to extend the lens and  power up  before you can start shooting  shutter lag is quite short  but longer than 35mm shutter lag times  the raw mode is a great feature because it produces a much smaller file than the tiff image modes of other cameras  raw images from the s40 run about 2800 kb and a tiff file might run as high as 9000 kb  canon includes a raw to tiff software conversion application in the s40 s bundle b st  patrick s day  after finishing the basic color test we took the s40 outdoors to shoot some  street  shots of the colorfully clad characters returning from the st  patrick s day parade  our local st  patrick s day celebration has a much more provincial flavor than those in new york and boston  with the spectators making up for their lack of sophistication with an abundance of enthusiasm and creativity  we spent about an hour shooting revelers wandering back and forth along bardstown road between the city s irish pubs  most of which are located in the highlands  the s40 produced consistently great color images of the passionate st  paddy s day partyers  especially considering how dreary and gray the weather was  caucasian skin tones in our outdoor tests came out a little pink  but that may have been more a result of the brisk breeze and mid thirties temperatures than anything relevant to the s40 s performance  optical distortion with the excellent 3x zoom was lower than average at the wide angle end  and the telephoto setting produced virtually distortion free images  chromatic aberration  purple fringing  was noticeable but well controlled  the zoom displayed some noticeable softness in the corners of the frame  low light performance was well above average  noise in longer exposures is well controlled  even at the iso 400 setting  macro performance is very good with high resolution in close up images  the s40 s flash performance is about average for point n shoot digital cameras  a bit weak for general shooting and a little hot for macro work  the s40 is surprisingly fast  shutter lag is almost non existent  and shot to shot times are excellent   mid america trucking show  the following saturday we got together saturday afternoon to visit the mid america trucking show  the largest  trucking theme show  in the world  more than 1 000 000 square feet of the cavernous west wing of the kentucky fair and exposition center is given over to this diesel extravaganza  the show started right here in louisville in 1971 and has gown bigger every year since  the mid america trucking show draws more than 80 000 visitors to the bluegrass state every spring to see the most beautifully painted and most technologically advanced trucks on the planet  my friend and i wanted to go because we had seen some shots of some the fantastic paint jobs on these diesel behemoths in tv ads for the show  many of the fanciest trucks are entered in the paul k  young memorial truck beauty championship  young was the founder the truck show and after his death in 1998 the organizers wanted a signature event named after him  the truck beauty contest is a natural  some of the semi s entered in the contest have wonderfully complex murals that stretch the full length of the cab and trailer  just the sort of colorful stuff that is perfect for camera tests  all the illumination at the kentucky fair and exposition center is fluorescent  so the truck show provided an excellent opportunity to check out the accuracy of the s40 s white balance system  which worked beautifully  there were also many people photography opportunities with more than 80 000 attendees from all fifty states and more than forty foreign countries and over 1000 exhibitors b a few concerns  the 3x zoom lens on the s40 is not threaded for use with add on lens adapters or filters  and this a really vexing omission  the built in flash is pretty weak and canon chose not to provide any capability for using external flash  another glaring omission in a four megapixel digital camera  battery life is decent  canon says 180 200 images with constant lcd use and over 400 using only the optical viewfinder  we got a bit more than two hours of heavy use from a fully charged battery  moderate lcd use  the included 16mb standard cf card isn t going to provide enough storage for anything more than a minor event  you ll need to purchase at least one 64mb card and an additional battery to fully utilize the s40   conclusion  after we finished our tests we printed the two best st  patrick s day image pairs at 5x7 and 8x10 and two 8x10 s from the truck show on an epson stylus photo epx 785 that we ve been testing  watch for the upcoming review of this exciting  digital darkroom  tool  we then carefully inspected the printed images using a mamiya 4x loupe designed for checking medium format prints  they were as good as similar images we d printed from the g2  color  contrast  resolution  and subjective  look  were comparable to any four megapixel digital camera currently available in terms of image quality  the s40 is an excellent general use digital camera that offers users just about all the manual exposure controls they might want  but works beautifully for neophyte photographers who want to shoot creative high quality digital images without learning basic photography skills  recommended without reservation are you considering spreading your imaging wings and setting up a  digital darkroom b  check out

222,auto, my mazda delivered everything i hoped for for the price and more  i bought it fresh out of college  and drove it happily for three years until totalling it in an accident  who would love one a college student  recent grad  or family on a budget who are looking for reliability and a car they won t be ashamed to drive  but not necessarily something too flashy pros  my mazda never once broke down  refused to start  stalled  or underperformed  the ride was more comfortable with 5 passengers than any other car i ve ridden in for its size  it also handled multiple carseats well when babysitting  and the back doors  openings were wide enough to be practical loading packages  pets  or kids  it was great on gas  30 34mpg with an automatic  easy to park  and had plenty of storage space in the trunk  it handled very well in nh snow   a very big concern for me in the purchase decision  braking and steering were very comfortable and responsive  car was powerful enough to merge into traffic in a short distance    it had a good package of standard safety features  visibility was overall very good  unlike some comparable 1997 makes with huge blind spots    when i priced insurance rates on it and other cars i was considering in its price class  the rates for the mazda were lower than its competitors the accident   a big pro the only reason i am not still driving this car is a big reason i would recommend it to others  i was in an accident where i was hit from the drivers side so hard that i spun into a guard rail  hitting it head on at about 20 mph  i am happy to report that the car performed above and beyond my expectations in this situation  both airbags deployed  and my seatbelt obviously worked well  as i would expect  the crumple zones certainly crumpled   the car looked a mess  however  considering the force of both impacts  and the fact that i walked away without so much as a scratch  says a great deal to me about the safety of the car  as a side note  as a smaller woman  the force of the airbags was not enough to hurt me  and the design of the car allowed easy enough reach of the controls that i did not have to sit on top of the steering wheel like in other cars i ve driven the car also had low impact bumpers  where another car  nudged  me a few times  and there were no dents or scratches left cons  acceleration could have been better  particularly when the car was heavily loaded  or when going uphill  the road noise was more prominent than in some of its competitors  baseline models are baseline   no frills there  the factory speakers weren t great   i ended up upgrading the stereo system  including the speakers    the transmission would sometimes shift a little heavily  and was not as smooth as other cars i ve ridden in  ,make deliver everything hop price buy fresh college drive happily three years total accident would love one college student recent glad family budget look reliability car ashamed drive necessarily something flash pro make never break refuse start stalk underperform ride comfortable passengers car ride size also handle multiple carpet well babysitting back doors open wide enough practical load package pet kiss great gas pg automatic easy park plenty storage space trunk handle well snow big concern purchase decision break sneer comfortable responsive car powerful enough merge traffic short distance good package standard safety feature visibility overall good unlike comparable make huge blind spot price insurance rat cars consider price class rat make lower competitors accident big pro reason still drive car big reason would recommend others accident hit drivers side hard spin guard rail hit head may happy report car perform beyond expectations situation airbags deploy seatbelt obviously work well would expect crumple bone certainly crumple car look mess however consider force impart fact walk away without much scratch say great deal safety car side note smaller woman force airbags enough hurt design car allow easy enough reach control sit top sneer wheel like cars drive car also low impact number another car nudge time debts scratch leave sons acceleration could better particularly car heavily load go uphill road noise prominent competitors vaseline model vaseline fill factory speakers great end upbraid sterno system include speakers transmission would sometimes shift little heavily smooth cars ride
223,camera, i originally bought this digital camera from best buy for a whopping  80  i  at the time  thought this was an excellent price  being a complete novice to digital camera shopping  i didn t realize that this digital camera listed no megapixel rating  this so called camera sits atop my computer desk as we speak  gathering dust  the battery holder lid is now missing  which means i cannot disconnect the camera from the computer since it cannot receive power any other way  the usb is like no other  meaning they can sell it exclusively for an insane  15  not to mention that the usb cord is extremely short  i must say  this digital camera has been dropped  banged  and been through multiple moving vans  and still takes quality pictures  or at least what aiptek calls  quality  overall  this camera has some nice features  it records voice  though sound quality is terrible  works as a webcam  though resolution is limited  and can take high and low resolution pictures  though they both are horrible  horrible quality  this camera is also extremely light sensitive  don t even think about taking indoor pictures  because there has to be blaring and blinding light shining on the scene for it to take the picture  if there is not enough lighting  the camera will make a low  annoying beep  if there is adequate lighting  it will make an even more annoying high pitched beep  the picture quality is grainy and just overall atrocious  high resolution pictures have to be shrunken to at least 300x300 to look remotely nice  my last words are  do not buy this product unless you re that desperate  this christmas i m buying myself the concord eye q go 2000 2 megapixel camera  i recommend you do the same  and never think about buying this camera ever again  ,originally buy digital camera best buy shop time think excellent price complete novice digital camera shop realize digital camera list megapixel rat call camera sit stop computer desk speak gather dust battery holder lid miss mean discontent camera computer since receive power way us like mean sell exclusively insane mention us cord extremely short must say digital camera drop bang multiple move van still take quality picture least aiptek call quality overall camera nice feature record voice though sound quality terrible work webcam though resolution limit take high low resolution picture though horrible quality camera also extremely light sensitive even think take indoor picture bear blind light shin scene take picture enough light camera make low annoy adequate light make even annoy high pitch picture quality grain overall atrocious high resolution picture drunken least look remote nice last word buy product unless desperate christmas buy concord eye go megapixel camera recommend never think buy camera ever
224,camera, as an amateur photographer who prefers a manual focus slr and prime lenses for control and picture quality  i wanted a digital camera to take snapshots and as a  backup  camera for traveling pictures  my search led to the sony dsc p71  a 3 2 megapixel camera with optional manual focus and digital settings that provide some decent options for picture taking  to my surprise  the p71 is a great little picture taker that often rivals the best of my nikon  it has a very nice feature  an autofocus illuminator  that enables the camera to focus even in the dark as long as your subject is within about ten feet  it also has very little  shutter lag  allowing you to take pictures in normal conditions quickly one after another  it has a comprehensive and simple menu that is displayed at your option on the bright and colorful lcd screen  and it allows you to format the pictures in the camera itself by zooming in and trimming as you like it  the only danger is that too much zooming will undermine the quality of your picture  you can also set it to landscape  twilight or twilight portrait mode  the last mode takes excellent photos of people at night yet still shows the city light background  it also has a 3x optical zoom that is excellent  but i do not recommend using the additional 2x digital zoom  again  this will make your pictures too grainy  another nice feature  it really feels like a camera  it s sturdy  the right size and has the lcd on the middle right where it should be  this way your left thumb can rest where it belongs  on the left side of the camera  too many digitals have the lcd screens on the left where your thumb belongs the initial memory  stick  of 16 megabytes is inadequate  i bought a 64 mg that holds 40 3 megapixel photos at one time  the provided battery charger is slow  it takes at least ten hours to charge  i bought a  one hour  charger that will recharge two backups in about 90 minutes  with these optional purchases the p71 is a complete package the p71 is made for connectivity  it has a usb port to a computer and a video out that allows you to put on a slide show directly from your camera  very nice  and the memory stick can be plugged directly into most printers today  it also has an adapter slot to connect to your wall to save batteries there are  of course  some negatives  there is no external flash  the internal flash is superior for a point and shoot camera  but a through the lens external flash would be better  there is no sound even for the movie mode  so don t get it if you want this to be your video camera  also  the pixel software for showing and adjusting your pictures is almost incomprehensible  the help brings up instructions but they are unclear and at times incomprehensible  the adjustment features are rudimentary and the interface with windows is terrible  the one time i did call pixela service for help i got a very nice live person almost immediately  but the software still stinks  thank goodness i already had adobe photoshop on my computer if you want a great digital camera that takes fantastic snapshots  that s compact and easy to use  then consider the 3 2 megapixel p71  it s all you will ever need and it s very quick for a digital camera  if you want movie sound  full manual controls  changeable lenses  external flash or to print out still shots larger than 8 x 10  consider a digital slr or the sony dsc 85  for most amateurs this is all the digital camera you will ever need  ,amateur photographer prefer manual focus sir prime lenses control picture quality

tooling down the highway enroute to one golf resort or another  with about a year left to go on the oldsmobile i got to thinking about minivans  and decided to do some research  i relied  too  on a friend who is now in his third straight minivan  no fords for advice on what  besides the cupholders  are the advantages of minivan ownership  i used the internet to do the research  relying heavily on kelly blue book  www kbb com   and www edmunds com  both are really good sites whether you are buying or leasing  and whether it s a car or a truck  bottom line is that between them and my buddy  although he is absolutely not a windstar guy  i decided that if i was getting a minivan it was going to be ford s  it was a close call over the honda odyssey  truth is there are a lot of great vehicles out there nowadays  maybe you won t go wrong with any of them  but i am thinking that for the money you can t get much safer or more comfortable  i ve been driving mine now for about four months  and i believe that i am ready to evaluate it  i don t know much at all about the technical stuff  but i do know that i am satisfied with the gas mileage  the ride is nice  of course  when your vehicle is new you are careful to miss most bumps larger than a bottlecap  but nevertheless i did not miss a few and i can tell you from experience  it s a nice ride  i got the se model with the  quot radar quot  in the back  that s the rear sensing system that saved me from an accident in a supermarket parking lot this past week  i never saw the guy  and i never would have had a chance if it wasn t for that alarm going off just in the nick of time  it s been the better part of 30 thirty years since i hit something i wasn t aiming at  and i can tell you i am real grateful for this alarm system  it would have been a minor ding i am sure  but it would have ruined a great driving record  thanks again ford  if this model doesn t have enough bells and whistles for you  well i gotta tell you that you are pretty spoiled  no matter though  they have two others  i think  loaded with even more stuff if you have to have it  the right side back door opens and closes at the push of a button  that s pretty neat  makes me wish i had gotten the left door that way too  you know what else is pretty neat  the outside mirrors   not only are they  quot powered mirrors quot  they are heated  to melt the ice which we will be getting our fair share of starting any day now  no more scraping mirrors  works for me  i could go on with what i like about it  but if you re looking to buy one of these or one of the competition s versions  then i better tell you what i don t like about it as well  gotta be fair  the right front door cannot be opened with a key   there is no keyhole  my vehicle has  quot keyless entry quot  so i shouldn t complain  but i don t keep that little  quot doo jigger quot  on my keyring  it s my emergency backup in case i stupidly leave my keys in the car  again  and sometimes it would be handy to access that door with a key  for someone else or for packages  for example  i am not crazy about my cupholders  the ones in the front section of the car just under the radio that you have to pull out like a drawer  well  they re a little chintzy if you ask me  i don t trust them to hold my medium diet pepsi  and they don t hold my coffee mug  so  what are they good for  like the song says  quot absolutely nothin quot  the only other thing that really bugs me is the back door lift gate or whatever they call it  if anything ought to be  quot powered quot  this is it  i m guessing that if there is one feature that costs ford the most customers this would have to be it  i believe that the ford people would do well to hire themselves a woman engineer to check this door out from the point of view of people who are less than 6 1  220  and make it so it s a wee bit more user friendly  dumbest door i ve ever seen  if you are thinking minivan for your next purchase  you might want to just take my word for it  i did the research  windstar is a good deal br br  ,first vehicle car never own motorcycle motorhome pick truck anything else mostly big room

226,camera, well  first off  this was my first digital camera  but i had done extensive amounts of research on them before coming to my conclusion  the main deciding factor was the price i was able to get it for off of ebay  well  the first thing that caught my eye  was the nice size  it is a nice travel companion  the 2 1 megapixels also helped because i knew i didnt want to go below two and have only internet worthy pics  but i wanted some power  i have taken this camera with me everywhere  and it has only failed me when i failed it  forgot to charge battery  wrong picture quality chosen  the case is amazing  i never would have thought that a company could make such a strong  metal  attractive case  and make it appealing to comsumers and professionals alike  because most digital cameras on the market now  will be made of pure weak plastic shells  and a good strong case is a thing to look for if you want the camera to last  and this one will  with only one exception on my opinion  the jog dial  i had the camera in my pocket one day and i was on the tile floor  and i slipped and fell  good news  no broken circuitry  bad news  the jog dial fell off  nothing a little super glue and a fine tuned eye couldnt fix  like 6 pieces were involved  the most impressive aspects of this camera really got to shine when i was taking close ups  very good detail  night shots with flash  and black and white  very crisp images  one of the things i didnt like was the fact that there were no image settings like sepia  of negative  only black and white  a very handy feature on this little guy is the half touch focus  you push down the shutter button halfway and it auto focuses  one of the things i didnt like  was the 16 frame movie mode  it was useful on a rare occasion because it is basicaly taking 16 pictures them seaming them into one big picture  not in any movie format  just a colage  if you do take that kind of a movie  you can watch it on the camera  no sound  jerky  but not on your computer  the software features one very handy feature quickfix  this is a one click solution to unscrewing the pictures that the camera screwed up in quality  other than that on the software  i just use it to download the pics to the computer which is easy enough for me  you can adjust the cameras bulb speeds  which i havent found handy yet  but yet is the key word  i love the lcd display so much compared to all of the ones offered on sony models and so on  it is very crisp  bright and easy to read  the lcd leads me to the battery life  which can be greatly reduced with the use of the lcd  the battery just never seemed to pull throught when i needed it most  but hey  for what you can buy this camera for these days  you might as well get a better battery  right  since im not a professional photographer  and i dont get paid for the pictures i take  me and the pdr m4 are a perfect match  but hey  who says a pro could tell the difference  most can t  over all  this camera is a great buy  the only camera that i will warn you not to buy if your life depends on it  is a sony mavica with a floppy drive  they are fat  loud  too bright  horrible picture quality  heavy  yet people and schools still buy them  don t waste your money  go for the pdr m4 it is worth every penny  ,well first first digital camera do extensive amount research come conclusion main decide factor price able get bay well first thing catch eye nice size nice travel companion megapixels also help know want go two internet worthy pick want power take camera everywhere fail fail forget charge battery wrong picture quality choose case amaze never would think company could make strong metal attractive case make appeal consumers professional alike digital camera market make pure weak plastic shell good strong case thing look want camera last one one exception opinion joy dial camera pocket one day tile floor slip fell good news break circuit bad news joy dial fell nothing little super blue fine tune eye fix like piece involve impressive aspects camera really get shine take close good detail night shots flash black white crisp image one things like fact image settings like septa negative black white handy feature little guy half touch focus push shutter button halfway auto focus one things like frame movie mode useful rare occasion basically take picture beam one big picture movie format courage take kind movie watch camera sound jerky computer software feature one handy feature quickfix one click solution screw picture camera screw quality software use download pick computer easy enough adjust camera bulb speed find handy yet yet key word love lead display much compare ones offer sonya model crisp bright easy read lead lead battery life greatly reduce use lead battery never seem pull think need hey buy camera days might well get better battery right since professional photographer dont get pay picture take per perfect match hey say pro could tell difference camera great buy camera warn buy life depend sonya mavra floppy drive fat loud bright horrible picture quality heavy yet people school still buy waste money go per worth every penny
227,camera, got this camera a week ago  and have been very pleased with it  i have lots of 35mm gear  which i use for more  quot serious quot  hobby photography  and so the main qualities i wanted in a digital camera were portability and cost savings in film processing  i think it is a great compliment to my other cameras  since i will use this mainly for sharing photos online with my family  where the resolution does not need to be so high  i thought this camera would be convenient the powershot uses compact flash cards  so if you go on vacation and don t have access to a computer to dump your pictures onto  you may want to pick up extra memory  i got 2 48mb cards  in addition to the 8mb that comes with it  the battery doesn t last very long if you use the lcd screen  but i usually look thru the viewfinder anyways  the menu system took a little while to get used to  but now it seems very natural and well laid out  there are a few tricks that are in the manual that you wouldn t figure out by just using the camera  for instance  to see the picture you just took  keep holding down the shutter release button  then  you can also delete it immediately connecting the camera to a computer to download pictures is really simple  just install the software that comes on cd  and when you plug the camera into your usb port  the software will automatically start  works great on both my imac  and my pc a really cool thing is the photo stitch feature and software  you can make a panorama by combining several photos together  using the lcd screen  you can line up shots side by side  then using the software  you can stitch or merge the photos together to get a very wide shot  you can even do a 360 degree panorama and make a quicktime vr movie with the software  i did this on my mac  and it can do it on the pc too  if you have quicktime 4 installed the quality of the images is fantastic  i am upgrading from a sony dsc f1 cybershot which is a few years old  and only did 640x480  the canon s resolution is so much better  file size is bigger too  and you have the option of 3 sizes  switching between them is easy the camera is so small  i carry it around with me all the time  after lugging around my 35mm gear  this is like a dream  of course  you don t have any depth of field control with this camera  you can adjust exposure   2  i think  but as a handy point and shoot  it is fantastic  also  since it uses the same  or close to it  body as the other canon aps elph ixy cameras  it is more discreet  with my cybershot  i had to always deal with questions about that camera  not a big deal  but still  people are more comfortable when a picture is taken with a  quot normal quot  camera  looking thru the viewfinder i think we will have this camera for years to come  i recommend it br br  ,get camera week ago please lot mm gear use quit serious quit hobby photography main qualities want digital camera probability cost save film process think great compliment camera since use mainly share photo online family resolution need high think camera would convenient powershot use compact flash card go vacation access computer dump picture onto may want pick extra memory get mb card addition mb come battery last long use lead screen usually look thou viewfinder anyway menu system take little get use seem natural well lay trick manual figure use camera instance see picture take keep hold shutter release button also delete immediately connect camera computer download picture really simple install software come plug camera us port software automatically start work great mac pp really cool thing photo stitch feature software make panorama combine several photo together use lead screen line shots side side use software stitch merge photo together get wide shoot even degree panorama make quicktime movie software mac pp quicktime instal quality image fantastic upbraid sonya duc cybershot years old canon resolution much better file size bigger option size twitch easy camera small carry around time lag around mm gear like dream course depth field control camera adjust exposure think handy point shoot fantastic also since use close body canon ix camera discreet cybershot always deal question camera big deal still people comfortable picture take quit normal quit camera look thou viewfinder think camera years come recommend br
228,camera, i bought this camera because my daughter had one and was very happy with it  i  also  love the camera  i have only had the camera for 3 weeks but have used it a lot  i wanted the camera to capture important family events  i was able to take pictures of my grandson s prom and graduation  it gave me the opportunity to review pictures to make sure i had good shots instead of waiting to have the film developed only to find i had lousy pictures  percentage of good pictures have far exceeded those taken with my 35mm camera  the review function allows you view and eliminate pictures that are not good thus giving you more space on your picture card  i suggest buying a larger picture card if you are planning on taking many pictures before saving them to a disk or computer br br  ,buy camera daughter one happy also love camera camera weeks use lot want camera capture important family events able take picture grandson granulation give opportunity review picture make sure good shots instead wait film develop find louse picture percentage good picture far exceed take mm camera review function allow view eliminate picture good thus give space picture card suggest buy larger picture card plan take many picture save disk computer br
229,auto, about ten years ago i would not have been caught dead driving a ford escort  they were the bottom of the food chain as far as i was concerned  however  ford again came up with a  better idea  and designed the escort zx2 i bought my 1998 escort zx2 new after owning a 1989 thunderbird for nine years  i had prepared myself for a big adjustment but was pleasantly surprised  i first chose the zx2 because of its low price and sporty look  when i test drove my car  i fell in love  the four cylinder  front wheel drive car offered a smooth ride and was quick to pick up speed from stop signs after i bought the car and drove it on a daily basis  i enjoyed it even more  the fuel mileage is excellent and after almost 26 000 miles the only repair i have had done is a cracked windshield  the car still looks sharp  drives great  and offers a comfortable ride i would recommend the escort zx2 for a single person or a married couple with no more than one child  the car has a fair amount of interior and trunk space  however  riding with four adults in the car and the air conditioning on takes a definite toll on the power and fuel mileage the only thing i have found that i do not like about my car is the lack of a mirror on the sun visor  perhaps this has been added to the newer zx2 s  ,ten years ago would catch dead drive ford escort bottom food chain far concern however ford come better idea design escort x buy escort x new own thunderbird nine years prepare big adjustment pleasantly surprise first choose x low price sport look test drive car fell love four cylinder front wheel drive car offer smooth ride quick pick speed stop sign buy car drive daily basis enjoy even fuel mileage excellent almost miles repair do crack windshield car still look sharp drive great offer comfortable ride would recommend escort x single person marry couple one child car fair amount interior trunk space however rid four adults car air condition take definite toll power fuel mileage thing find like car lack mirror sun vigor perhaps add newer x
230,camera, hello all  it s been a while since i wrote an epinion  i have a few new digicams to write about  this epinion is about my  newest  aquisition  i work for staples here in n e  pa ans one day a customer came in with an old digital camera he got on ebay  it was in a bundle pack of cameras he bid on   he wanted an olympus cam that was in the pack  he had this other cam that was in there  he wanted to see if it worked  and if it did he was giving it to his pastor  anyway it worked  and had me interested  i went online to look at this cam and see what it s specs were  it seemed interesting  and the more i read the more i wanted one  so off to ebay i went  took a while to win on one  seems they are very popular now  used to be a  1 000 00 camera in it s day  1997  they now go for between  20 00 and  100 00  give or take  i got mine for  36 00 with shipping and insurance  paypal  it arrived as they said it would  as is  no books  no software  and no cables  just the camera  i put in 4 ni mh aa batteries  and a 16 mb compact flash card that i had here  and turned the play switch on  it came on  so far so good  i turned it off  and slid the on switch for taking pics to the open side  exposing the front of the viewfinder  and the flash sensor  and powering the cam  it made some noises and the rear lcd came to life  telling me i had around 60 pics  was set to best mode  has 4 levels of quality  good  better  best   and uncompressed  which actually still has some compression actually  kodak lied about a few things back then  i ll get to more on this later  anyway  i anxiously aimed the cam at one of my cats  and pressed the shutter down 1 2 way  the cam focused  and the ready light blinked  i pressed the rest of the way  the flash went off  and the cam saved the pic  i went back to the playback  and the pic came up on screen  it worked   smiles  so i got a working one  and in good shape too  only a little dust inside the lens  time to experiment  smiles  well  first the main specs of the cam  and i ll mention where kodak lied  resolution 1280x960  making this a 1 2mp cam  actual chip resolution 850x984  or 836 400 pixels  so in fact this isn t a megapixel cam as kodak claimed  ahh well  for me no big deal  as i allready knew this memory  built in  2 mb  also takes cf cards  up to at least 128 mb that i tested 24 bit color depth iso equivalent of iso 160  so it s just about a good all around cam 3x optical zoom  no digital zoom auto focus 2 3 ft to infinity  using ir for focusing close up focus 0 7 feet to 1 6 feet  0 2 to 0 5 m zoom length 38mm to 114 mm 35 mm cam equivalent  actual focal length 7mm to 21 mm flash range on wide  2 3 ft to 16 4 feet  on tele 2 3 ft to 10 8 feet aperture  wide f 2 5 to f 16 tele f 3 8 to f 24 shutter speed  one of the things i liked  1 500th to 16 seconds  great for night shots viewfinder zooming optical  now like i said  i only got the cam  nothing else  but i do have card readers for cf cards  so no biggie  i put the card in to the reader  and checked the pics  kodak used a different picture file format here  it ends with a  kdc  it s actually a form of  jpg  i know because the hp photosmart printers we have at work will let you see the pic  but on thre it looks blurry  minor differences make it unuseable this way right from the cam  normally i d have been stuck without the conversion software kodak uses  but luckily you can dl it from kodak  or use any other program that reads  kdc format  paint shop pro 7 does  as does irfanview  for examples  the cam saves all pics in the 1280x960 resolution  interpolating them up from 850x960  so they look a little soft  not sharp  a little resizing to 850x637  which is what they are when you try to match the resolution horizontaly  without loosing the aspect ratio helps to sharpen the pics up  as does using the sharpening controls of your favorite photo editor  once you save the file as a  jpg or whatever you like  i find that irfanview s sharpening filter or photoshops unsharp mask work best  making the pics useable for web and also printing  up to 5x7 depending on the pic  i have been taking this cam everywhere with me  along with my other new cam  my toshiba pdr 3300 3 2 mp  they both have good and bad sides and work well as a combo  the dc120 will focus in any light even darkness  since it uses ir  the toshiba uses edge detection  so the subject has to have some light on it for focus  this cam is not hard to use once you figure the controls out  it can be used 1 handed  once you set the zoom  there is a hand strap on the right side  like a camcorder  keeping the cam on your hand well  you don t use the viewscreen on back to set up the shot  you can  but it works better if you don t  and saves batteries  there are some bad parts to this cam  for one  it s a discontinued cam  so no support really from kodak  2 you have to buy them used  so who knows what condition they will be in  but the price is usually good there can be defects on the cam  for example  mine has a slight problem with hot pixels showing up on dark photos  hot pixels look liek white specks in the pic  not a major prob  unless taking pics of a starry sky  smiles  mine also has dust inside the lens  so far i don t think it s affected the pics  when taking pics in the highest quality mode  it takes about 10 seconds to save the pic  and be ready for the next one  so it s a bit slow  just plan your shots right  smiles  some features i liked  and also made me get one of these were  when shooting close up mode  the display comes on when you hold the shuter down 1 2 way  letting you see the pic better than using the viewfinder  also  when in close up mode you manually focus the cam  using the zoom buttons  also shows the distance focused for on the little lcd  this is the only time the cam has manual focus  but i still like it  i liek the shape of it  it is the size of a good sized paperback novel  and you use it looking down the longest part of the cam  like binoculars sort of it s not a heavy cam  has a big lens  letting in more light it seems  and i been told it uses a ccd imaging chip as opposed to a cmos chip like the cheaper cams now use  allowing for better color reproduction  i have gotten some very nice pictures from this cam  you can still get add on lenses and filters for this cam used and new  check with tiffen  i love the ir focus system  hasn t really failed me yet  and seems right on the money when it focuses  now  don t get me wrong  this cam isn t as good as my toshiba pdr 3300 for serious pictures  the 3 2 mp images are very sharp  but it makes a nice 2nd cam  replacing my other cams i reviewed in previous epinions for the most part  i for one am very happy with this cam  and would suggest that anyone interested in a very inexpensive cam to play around with  check ebay and try to get one  unless you get a defective unit  you won t be disapointed  that s all for now  if you

232,auto, i should clarify that i got this as a rental  i didn t ask for it  but they had already given away the standard full size car i wanted  so they  quot upgraded quot  me to the town car  i think it s called the town car because you could fit the population of a small town inside it  as big as it is  i thought it would be unmanuverable and slow  it s not  it accelerates quickly  but the only way i knew was to look at the speedometer  you can t feel a thing in this car  driving a town car is a lot like sitting on a plush  comfy couch while playing a really good driving simulator on a computer  the seats are amazingly comfortable  and the car has less engine road noise than any vehicle i have ever seen  there is no feedback from the road and the steering is incredibly sensitive  i kept wandering in the lane because the slightest pressure on the wheel and the car changes direction  inattention could be disasterous because the first warning that you have turned would be the crunch of the bumper b man that s big b  not that hitting a guardrail would harm you  the bumper is waaay at the front of the car  outside of a heavy truck i can t think of many vehicles that would be safer than this one  besides the normal complement of air bags  it also has a warning light that bongs  at you if the driver hasn t buckled the seat belt  if i owned this car that would be the first fuse to come out  it doesn t easily fit into parking spaces  six people could easily ride in it and the trunk is large enough to sleep two  but it doesn t look bad  the styling is very nice  and it s a very comfortable car in all respects  surprisingly for such a big car  it still gets about 20mpg in mixed driving  not great  but i was expecting faster fuel consumption b how do i b everything in this car is powered  the seat  quot remembers quot  your settings and when you stop the car it pulls back to allow you to get out easier  when you start the car it slides you to your preferred position  the seat controls are extensive and far easier to use than in my grand prix  the button is shaped like a seat and you just push it in the direction you want to go  the gas and trunk buttons are right there on the door  there is also a very useful display near the speedometer that shows your current direction  fuel mileage  ect  radio and climate control buttons are provided on the steering wheel  but there isn t enough of them to control either adequately  there are so many buttons it takes time to figure them all out  i figured the climate control out  and in atlanta a c is important  driver storage space is excellent  there is a fold down armrest with plenty of space and there is a small map compartment in the door armrest  this is a nice luxury car that really pampers you  if you want to really feel your driving  look elsewhere     ,clarify get rental ask already give away standard full size car want quit upgrade quit town car think call town car could fit population small town inside big think would unmanuverable slow accelerate quickly way know look speedometer feel thing car drive town car lot like sit plush come couch play really good drive simulate computer seat amazingly comfortable car less engine road noise vehicle ever see feedback road sneer incredibly sensitive keep wander lane slightest pressure wheel car change direction inattention could disastrous first warn turn would crutch jumper man big hit guardrail would harm jumper way front car outside heavy truck think many vehicles would safer one besides normal complement air bag also warn light bone driver buckle seat belt own car would first fuse come easily fit park space six people could easily ride trunk large enough sleep two look bad say nice comfortable car respect surprisingly big car still get pg mix drive great expect faster fuel consumption everything car lower seat quit remember quit settings stop car pull back allow get easier start car side prefer position seat control extensive far easier use grand prim button shape like seat push direction want go gas trunk button right door also useful display near speedometer show current direction fuel mileage act radio climate control button provide sneer wheel enough control either adequately many button take time figure figure climate control atlanta important driver storage space excellent fold arrest plenty space small map compartment door arrest nice luxury car really paper want really feel drive look elsewhere

237,camera, my history i blindly purchased my first digital camera  a kodak  four years ago by ordering one off the internet because my rural town didn t have any digital cameras in stock  i choose the kodak dc 240 1 3 mp camera  i was thrilled with it  when i showed people my photos  they raved they looked like magazine photos  i thought i was a good photographer   amazingly though   it wasn t me   it was all kodak  now  having tried many other cameras   i know i was blessed when i blindly chose kodak for many reasons in my pursuit to buy a new camera  i blindly sent away for another kodak  except this time i got a bomb  i bought the dx3900  and it was so bad   i immediately put it up for auction on e bay  i was so disappointed i can t even begin to say  next i bought the latest and greatest nikon 5000 camera  i set it up to  point and shoot  and whoa i was so disappointed  mind you this is a top of the line slr 5mp camera with an 8x optical zoom   but it just didn t take quality photos in point and shoot mode  the shutter lag was insane  i often missed my subjects it was sooo slow  the lens hunted around in blur mode half the time  i couldn t take it  my old kodak was quick  for the money  1100  i felt robbed  i quickly returned it next  i bought the minolta s404  i tried it out at target and thankfully  the shutter lag was more tolerable and the hunting mode   while still present   wasn t quite as bad as the nikon  i figured it was less complex and might be able to meet my needs  i bought it and took it home  sadly  all the photos were dark  there was no software worth speaking about either with the minolta  they seemed to have taken shortcuts compared to kodak  i was paying more and getting less  none of the photos looked like the magazine photos i used to know with my kodak  the color was pathetic   even after using their software to improve it  upon reviewing photos at several sites like www imaging resources   i realized the minotla was a flawed camera too  it didn t hold a candle to my old kodak  i immediately returned it the kodak dx4330 ahh and then i saw the newest camera come out by kodak on kodak s site and i had to try it  i ran out to circuit city and tried it  the shutter lag and auto focus hunting are my biggest complaint with most cameras  they are sooooo slow  when i tried the new kodak dx4330   wow   it was great   like my old dc240  i purchased it and took it home  i was reserved but excited i quickly unwrapped it  and snapped a few photos  i never even opened up the manual and i quickly and intuitively figured out how to download the photos via the usb cable provided  this camera is great for anyone   the learning curve is zero  the first pictures were simply amazing  smashingly beautiful and as my first friend who saw the first photo said   they look like magazine photos  yes  kodak did it again i am not going to spend time reviewing the features of the camera  you can do that by clicking on the  specs  or by going to the manufacturers page  i will tell you this is a 3 1 mp camera with little manual override features that competes with the best of them in quality  color and accuracy  you can blow up photos to 11x14 with incredible quality i can take sunsets and get fabulous color  which the minolta could not do no matter what the setting  i can get great night shots outside with the porch light on and i can take great photos indoors or outside  again the minolta failed on the indoor shots  you can also take fabulous macro shots   again this camera beat the minolta hands down  i didn t test the nikon on this the color is nearly perfect as well  again minolta couldn t capture cherry red  take a photo and compare it to reality   you ll be impressed  kodak also supplies some great software with it too which allows you to crop  color adjust  covert to black n white  balance light dark  enhance  eliminate red eye  etc  the software is slick   quick and easy the camera is small  very light weight and the 2 aa batteries last for 180   shots using the flash and the review mode to see photos after they are taken  the storage media is secure digital so far  no complaints about that either the date stamp isn t the greatest as it is rather large and bright yellow   but it is there if you want it  there is no time stamp the software which comes with the camera is pleasing  it serves all my needs though i don t like the way kodak makes you save photos to e mail people  i use another software to downsize the images  you also can t rename them using kodak s software which is a flaw   but minor to live with  when you save photos to your hard drive  kodak automatically files them in a folder with the date  you can override this and create your own naming conventions the downloading via the usb is amazingly quick and very simple  you can t mess it up  it s all intuitive  you can see a little thumbnail of each photo being downloaded which is great  then when they are all downloaded  kodak s software lets you view the photos in full screen slideshow mode i recently blew up the  first photo  i took with this camera as it was that pleasing   to an 11 x 14   and it looks professional the quality that is good this is a must buy  if you are thinking about it   don t  get one today  you won t regret it if you are a novice or anyone who doesn t want to bother with all the old 35mm pre sets  the camera can easily fit into a purse and off you go to shoot  i average about 400 photos a week now  there is some blue casting on brightly lit shots   its the only negative i have seen   but compared to what i saw in other cameras   i ll gladly keep it happy camera hunting  ,history blandly purchase first digital camera today four years ago order one internet rural town digital camera

238,camera, been using the canon digital elph s100 powershot after having used the sony mavica family of cameras as well as the kodak dc 280 and 3400  i have to say that the canon s100 is by far the best  for all the same features  you get with the other cameras  you get so much more with the canon  it s got a small form factor that really makes it so convenient to carry around  that s the huge advantage with this camera  who wants to lug around their beastly sony mavica around after using this it s easy to set up  and the picture quality is fantastic  you can t beat that  my only gripes  canon doesn t include a spare battery  the stock compact flash card is only 8 mb  and there is no case included  kinda cheap for a camera that is really nice the powershot s100 features an elegant  stainless steel  sus316  body equipped with a number of advanced camera features including a 35 70mm  35mm equivalent  f 2 8 4 0 all glass aspherical lens to help minimize image distortion  a 4x digital converter extends the zoom range of the lens to 8x when used in conjunction with its 2x optical zoom capabilities  in addition  the camera is equipped with a three point aiaf autofocus system that permits the camera to automatically select the primary subject  even if the subject is off center  to further simplify overall operation  the digital elph displays most camera settings on the lcd monitor  while using the control buttons at the base of the monitor  users can confirm desired camera functions identified on the lcd monitor with easy to understand icons or minimal text the digital elph features a 0 37 inch  2 1 megapixel ccd sensor that creates full color or black and white images up to 1600x1200 pixels when set to the camera s large resolution mode  the camera also offers an additional resolution setting of 640 x 480 when set in the small mode  which is ideal for on screen applications  such as web sites and cd roms and allows more images to be recorded on a single compactflash memory card  the new camera is compatible with type i compactflash cards and will be shipped with an 8mb cf card in order to maximize the capabilities of the 2 1 megapixel ccd  the powershot s100 is equipped with a dedicated digital signal processing integrated circuit  ic  to achieve high speed and complete processing of image detail  all images are recorded as jpeg files and a built in buffer memory allows continuous burst mode shooting of up to 2 frames per second when set to its maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200  the interval between shots in single frame mode is only 1 7

239,auto, i have already written a review on a  86 mazda b2200 cab plus  but now it s time to write about the truck that replaced my fathers old truck  b2200  and bestowed it upon me we needed to get another vehicle since i was an up and coming driver  so my dad very pleased with his old mazda  bought a  89 b2000 with 105k on it  i asked if he thought that was a lot  but he quickly denied it for it was a mazda  those things run forever  he said  and he was right he bought a  89 b2000 that was bone stock  the guy who bought it new didn t even get a radio in it  that s how stock it was  no matter  though  mazda isn t really renowned for it s superior audio  in trucks  anyways  it had the 4 cyl  5 spd  like every other mazda out there  and it ran great  still does last summer  we had severe flooding and thunderstorms in our area  central pa  and my dad had to make an emergency trip to work  because the storm took out some transformers  or something  and since my dad is an electrician at a large factory  he was called in  on the way there  there was lots of flooding  most of it in places you wouldn t expect  the little mazda got into water up to the hood  and my dad quickly evacuated  waiting on a nearby porch for the water to recede  it did  and my dad climbed in his mazda submarine  and drove away  of course it was driving like a pile of junk  water got in the oil  but a quick change of oil  and it was back to new  except for the water lines inside the cab  and lot s of junk stuck in strange places  it s still up and running strong a year later  no major repairs other than exhaust  and brakes  great truck  i wish i still had mine  any vehicle that survives a flood with flying colors deserves to be in everyone s garage br br  ,already write review make cab plus time write truck replace father old truck bestow upon need get another vehicle since come driver dad please old make buy ask think lot quickly deny make things run forever say right buy bone stock guy buy new even get radio stock matter though make really renowned superior audit trunks anyway cy sad like every make run great still last summer severe flood thunderstorms area central pa dad make emergency trip work storm take transformer something since dad electricity large factory call way lot flood place expect little make get water hood dad quickly evacuate wait nearby porch water recede dad climb make submarine drive away course drive like pile june water get oil quick change oil back new except water line inside cab lot june stick strange place still run strong year later major repair exhaust rake great truck wish still mine vehicle survive flood fly color deserve everyone garage br
240,camera, the sony dsc p20 was my second digital camera  i ve used it for six months  the camera itself is relatively small  not too small and not oversized like low end kodak or hp models  at first glance  the camera looks to be another great quality product from sony  after you use it and look at the picture quality it s a different story  here are the details the specs the dsc p20 is a 1 3 megapixel camera  it takes pictures at 1280x960 maximum resoultion  it also has 512x384  640x480  and 1024x768 resolutions  the features include a count down timer  red eye reudction  integrated flash  1 5  color lcd screen  and viewfinder  the dsc p20 uses sony s popular memory stick format  which currently sells from 2mb to 128mb sticks  the camera is made of durable plastic  and uses a usb connection to link to the pc  the camera also uses 2 aa batteries or the optional sony npfs11 infolithium ion batteries  not included  if you decide to use regular aa batteries the battery life is only 20   30 minutes total or about 12 shots with the flash  some people have reported even less  i was using 2 aa nimh 1800mah batteries and they lasted about 1 hour total  using the npfs11 lithium ion will last you 2 5 hours  the dsc p20 comes with 3x digital zoom and no optical zoom  i found the images to be slightly degraded when i used the zoom up to 3x but its hardly noticiable  the camera also comes with different picture effects such as black white  solarize  sepia  and negative modes  the camera saves images as  tiff  jpeg  or gif  it also takes mpeg movies  no sound  at 320x240 or 160x120  the camera also has a  macro  feature which will sharpen and focus in on images that are 3 feet or closer  the sony dsc p20 is loaded with features the package there are not many accessories that are included with the dsc p20  included in the box are  2 sony aa batteries  wont last you very long  camera wrist strap  the most useful item included in the box  and a 4mb sony memory stick  only lets you store 6   10 jpeg full size shots at full resolution  also included are the manuals and software drivers cd rom  and usb transfer cable  i suggest that you either go purchase some good 1800mah nimh rechargable batteries because alkaline batteries will not last very long  this camera has extremly low battery life  or if you are rich  you can buy the npfs11 infolithium battery for  89 99 cad or  60 00 usd  also you might also want to get a 32mb or higher memory stick  i had a 64mb memory stick which stored 118 jpegs shots at full quality and higest resolution  or 36 tiff uncompressed shots  or 11 minutes of mpeg video  the package does not include a camera bag  which i recommend if you want to carry the camera around often  also not included is the optional ac adapter for the camera  optional accessory packages like the sony acccspw for dsc p20  dsc p30  and dsc p50  includes the npfs11 battery pack  carrying case and ac adapter charger  the accessory package is around  75 00 usd or  145 00 cad the pros in detail the sony dsc p20 is relatively cheap compared to other sony digital cameras  you can probably get it for even cheaper than  200us since it is a 2001 model  also this camera acts as a memory stick drive  this is an excellent feature  you can transfer any kind of files to and from your memory stick like a removable hard drive  also this camera is very easy to use  i didnt even need to read the manual and i figured out all the features etc the cons in detail the biggest con about this camera is the picture quality  the picture quality is not as good as it should be  and it is absolutely horrible in low light conditions  the pictures are usually fine in outdoor light  however indoor light may have undesirable results such as  slight discoloration  and sometimes grainy pixels  in low light conditions the camera is especially bad  because the integrated flash is relatively weak  also the red eye reduction will not work properly sometimes  the dsc p20 s lcd screen scratches quite easily  and needs a camera bag if you are likely to get it scratched  another major con is obviously the battery life using standard aa batteries  this camera has the worst battery life i have ever seen  i used up the 2 aa batteries that were included in the box in 15minutes  i was only testing all the features and playing with the camera when i got a low battery warning do i still own this camera  no if you want a sony digital camera i would suggest a newer more mid level sony camera  it ll be more expensive but it will be worth it if you want a excellent quality low cost digital camera  check out the canon a30 or a40 both are loaded with features and excellent picture quality  see my review on the canon a30  the camera i m using now

241,camera, i ve had my epson photopc 700 for some time now and can t remember what it was like not to have it  probably one of the best investments i have ever made  not only do i never have to wait for film to be developed  but i can also view my pictures right away thus deciding if i want to keep a particular photo or not this camera came with a battery charger and the ability to add photo cards for even more storage  the camera itself holds 50 pictures in it s standard mode  add to that the option of purchasing a thin little card that just slides into a slot and you can have up to 200 more pictures  not once having to wait to change film the convience of being able to load the pictures onto my pc makes it that much more appealing  add a photo printer to your system and you never have to go to a photolab again  however  if you aren t able to print out your own photo s you can still take the photo to a lab and have them turn it into a hardcopy for you some of the options include an amazing zoom  i can zoom in up to 3x on any given item  there is a built in timer for taking pictures as well as special features for taking close shots that show a lot of detail  one of my favorite features is the ability to take black and white pictures with just the push of a button  there is no need to carry more then one camera  this camera can switch from standard pictures to speciality pictures with just the click of a few buttons the pictures are much more clear with a digital camera  you can even catch individual snowflakes as they fall  have you ever tried to take pictures of fireworks with a regular camera  i have and they never turn out  this digital camera picked them up perfectly  i would defanitely be lost without it though it is a bit pricey  it is well worth the extra money  the first week i had the camera it paid for itself just in the amount of film and cost for developing it would have cost  the best part was that i only ended up with pictures i wanted  no more wasting film on shots that just didn t turn out     ,elson photo time remember like probably one best investments ever make never wait film develop also view picture right away thus decide want keep particular photo camera come battery charge ability add photo card even storage camera hold picture standard mode add option purchase thin little card side slot picture wait change film convince able load picture onto pp make much appeal add photo printer system never go photolab however able print photo still take photo lab turn hardcopy option include amaze room room give item build time take picture well special feature take close shots show lot detail one favorite feature ability take black white picture push button need carry one camera camera switch standard picture specially picture click button picture much clear digital camera even catch individual snowflakes fall ever try take picture fireworks regular camera never turn digital camera pick perfectly would definitely lose without though bite price well worth extra money first week camera pay amount film cost develop would cost best part end picture want waste film shots turn
242,camera, in the quest to provide learning experiences for my students  i was introduced to the sony mavica line of digital cameras  in case you are not up on the latest news regarding the state of public education  there is little money in the budget for this sort of tool  however  because i often use the technology of the computer and presentation software in my classroom  this item became a must have  i purchased the fd 83 for my personal use  but  like many other teachers  i use it in the classroom  it is very simple to use  it has great portability  and due to the media it uses to capture images   a standard 3 5 floppy disk  it is a resource that can be utilized by several students during a class period  my students used both the still image function as well as the mpeg function to create a community service project aimed at helping students new to middle school adjust  the kids quickly figured out which pictures they could take and immediately put to use  the bonus that the mavica offered was that a disk could be ejected and the camera was immediately ready for another student to use  in addition the images captured on disk by the first student were ready as well   gone are the days of downloads that take longer than the research for a paper of project  the pc mode disks posed no problem for our apple computers and graphiconverter  the videos transferred well and responded well as a facet of a presentation piece using hyperstudio  the camera also offers several filters with which one can alter pictures while still in the camera  if one is dissatisfied with the filters  sepia and black and white are two of them  one can remove them  the black and white option came in quite handy when putting parts of a presentation on paper to be photocopied  the disk copy tool is invaluable when one wants to be sure that the pictures are in more than one place  with this option one can copy from one image to the entire disk of images in less than two minutes  and without any extra equipment  this eliminated the  quot my partner is absent quot  dilemma which many teachers face in group work  the floppy media also saved a great deal of class time as i did not need to download a memory card as i once did  each floppy disk holds up to 40 images using the standard resolution  a bonus when working with students  however  this number drops drastically when the resolution is fine  a floppy only retains 7 fine resolution images  the mpeg function will record up to one minute of video and that uses all of the space on the floppy  i have found that one can override the 5  10  and 15 second preset times for video capture  if one simply continues to depress the operating button past the preset time  the camera will continue to record  up to 60 continuous seconds the resolution is more than adequate for the images that my students take  and it is often quite good  belying its low pixel ratio     ,quest provide learn experience students introduce sonya mavra line digital camera case latest news regard state public education little money budget sort tool however often use technology computer presentation software classroom item become must purchase ff personal use like many teachers use classroom simple use great probability due media use capture image standard floppy disk resource utilize several students class period students use still image function well peg function create community service project aim help students new middle school adjust kiss quickly figure picture could take immediately put use bonus mavra offer disk could eject camera immediately ready another student use addition image capture disk first student ready well go days download take longer research paper project pp mode disk pose problem apple computers graphiconverter video transfer well respond well facet presentation piece use hyperstudio camera also offer several filter one alter picture still camera one dissatisfy filter septa black white two one remove black white option come quite handy put part presentation paper photocopy disk copy tool invaluable one want sure picture one place option one copy one image entire disk image less two minutes without extra equipment eliminate quit partner absent quit dilemma many teachers face group work floppy media also save great deal class time need download memory card floppy disk hold image use standard resolution bonus work students however number drop practically resolution fine floppy retain fine resolution image peg function record one minute video use space floppy find one overrule second present time video capture one simply continue depress operate button past present time camera continue record continuous second resolution adequate image students take often quite good belie low fix ratio
243,auto, with gm s recent announcement of their decision to discontinue the camaro firebird  that leaves on classic ponycar still in production today  the ford mustang the ford mustang is an american ponycar icon that still sells quite well in today s generation  during a recent test drive  i was able to experience first hand what driving a mustang is all about exterior the mustang is designed with classic muscle car looks  the large front grill with the classic pony suggests a mean  get out of my way attitude  the whole car s design is a real headturner in my opinion  i especially like the rear deck and tailight design which is the view most drivers had on the road while i drove this mustang  my mustang was painted performance red which looks outstanding on this car  interior thus mustang s interior is fairly simply laid out  the instrument panel is very cleanly designed and easy to read  the optional mach 460 sound system rocks for a factory installed system  interior room is just average though  and quite tight in the rear seats  but this is a sports car  and thats expected  i think ford could have done a better job on the seats  since the mustang is a performance car  and most people will drive it hard  it could use better side bolstering to keep the driver in place while manuvering through traffic  noise insulation is not great  but once again this is a sports car and that is expected engine ride i drove a mustang gt equiped with ford s growly and powerful 4 6 v8  horsepower is a very impressive 260 and the overwhelming power pushed me into my seat while accelerating hard from stoplights  the mustang s v8 makes a pleasent exhaust growl which is a true musclecar feature  the auto transmission mustang i drove had more than adequate power throughout the rev range  however  i think a manual would be more fun  the mustang s ride quality is just average  due to the tuned suspension which is designed for spirited driving  value the mustang gt retails for anywhere between  21 000 24 000 depending on the level of equipment and options you select  this is one of the best  bang for your buck  vehicles on the market today  however the mustang is very expensive to insure and previous mustang s have had some repair issues and ford doesn t have the greatest build quality reputation as with most domestic automakers  i would buy the mustang someday as a second car to drive on weekends  but wouldn t recommend it as an everyday car  sports cars in general are not comfortable or practical to drive in everyday situations  but if you want a car that will get to where you need to go in very quickly with a lot of style and tradition  without breaking the bank  consider the ford mustang  ,go recent announcement decision discontinue camera firebird leave classic ponycar still production today ford ford american ponycar icon still cells quite well today generation recent test drive able experience first hand drive exterior design classic muscle car look large front drill classic pony suggest mean get way attitude whole car design real headturner opinion especially like rear deck twilight design view drivers road drive paint performance red look outstanding car interior thus interior fairly simply lay instrument panel cleanly design easy read optional much sound system rock factory instal system interior room average though quite tight rear seat sport car expect think ford could do better job seat since performance car people drive hard could use better side blister keep driver place manuvering traffic noise induration great sport car expect engine ride drive equip ford growl powerful horsepower impressive overwhelm power push seat accelerate hard stoplights make pleasant exhaust growl true musclecar feature auto transmission drive adequate power throughout rev range however think manual would fun ride quality average due tune suspension design spirit drive value detail anywhere depend level equipment option select one best bang buck vehicles market today however expensive insure previous repair issue ford greatest build quality reputation domestic automakers would buy someday second car drive weekend recommend everyday car sport cars general comfortable practical drive everyday situations want car get need go quickly lot style tradition without break bank consider ford
244,camera, comparison  i compared five 5m cameras before settling on the nikon 5400  film wise i ve dabbled with photography for quite a while  starting with an olympus xa1  and i ve had a canon eos 1000f slr for 12 years  i bought an olympus d 540l some time ago  which is 0 75m camera  it s taken some nice pics but as you re probably aware these won t print out at more than 3  x 2  since film photography is expensive and frustrating if you don t have your own development equipment  digital photography is the way to go  my opinion is you need a 4 5m camera to replace a 35mm camera  full manual override is a must as well the cameras i looked at    canon g5   sony v1   olympus c5050   nikon 5700   nikon 5400 a good way to compare features is to go to http www dpreview com  the  buying guide  menu and choose  side by side  a lot of the features are similar and it s pretty close these days between the manufacturers  visual quality of the cameras is improving at a marked rate and it s difficult to choose between them here  the cameras do have certain features that have pros and cons and this is where you draw your final conclusion  here is my summary of the 5 cameras listed above    canon g5   when you hold this in the shop next to the 5400 and v1 it feels like a brick  it is large and bulky  but all the features are easily accessible and it doesn t feel fiddly  personally i think this has the worst artifacts out of all the cameras listed above  colour balance and tone are great but if you look at the resolution test  on comparion  you ll see that diagonals are aliased and there are slight green fringes to black edges  conclusion  i decided against this camera because of its size and artifacts    sony v1   this is the most compact of the above cameras and for has the massive plus of a carl zeiss lens  i used to have an olympus xa1  which was a compact point and click 35mm camera  which also had a carl zeiss lens  i think it took some of the best pictures i ve ever taken  looking at the results on this site  this camera takes excellent pictures and sony seem to have sorted out the colour balancing on this model  it is nice and compact and has an automatic lens cover which is a nice feature  it s size is both a plus and a minus though  if you have large hands i don t think you ll like this camera  it is not easy to hold  it has some interesting features  like you can take pictures in complete darkness using it s infra red mode  it will also focus perfectly in the dark  compared to the other cameras is is quite cheap  but then you have to use more expensive sony memory cards and you have to buy sony attachements  e g  external flash  this is the only camera which doesn t have moveable screen   and you ll wish you did have one once you ve had a camera that has this feature  conclusion  i decided against this camera because it was so awkward to hold in the shop and the menus seemed a bit fiddly to select option settings  also it doesn t have a moveable viewing screen and you must buy sony accessories    olympus c5050   this camera is the oldest of the ones above i believe  i ve been quite impressed with my old olympus 540l  despite it s low resolution and age i think it take pretty good pictures  i think olympus are a little underrated personally as sony  nikon and canon seem to get all the attention  this camera is supposed to be very good in low light  and i like twilight photography so i did consider this camera  it feels good in your hand taking photos and the image quality is excellent  just look at the comparions  conclusion  i decided against this model as it s been out quite a while and i think the imaging software has moved on since then  it moves at a very rapid pace  the reviews point out some arifacts and i d rather not have those  despite getting at recommended rating    nikon 5700   this camera gets good reviews  it feels nice to hold  it has good functionality and takes excellent photos  it has an 8x optical zoom  which is fantastic  but because of this the camera feels more like an slr as it larger than the others  this camera is more expensive than the others but has all their features and the zoom  conclusion  if you want a camera with big zoom  i d look at some of the cheaper olympus models  there s an old maxim in photography  if you want to zoom in on a subject move closer to it  if you get a big zoom and you don t have good light you re just going to get camera shake  you even start to notice it on some of the 3x and 4x zoom models  this is a great camera  but just not quite what i was looking for    nikon 5400   i think this has the same body as the 5700 but with a 28 116mm equivalent lens  when i had my canon eos 1000f  it came with a 35 80mm lens  i soon changed this for a 28 70mm lens because more often than not you use wide angle than zoom  when you do need zoom 3 or 4 times is plenty  you rarely need 8x or 10x optical zoom and when you do you can sacrifice a little quality and do it digitally  so as you can probably tell this sold the camera to me  other than that  the camera feel great to hold  has a good rubber grip  and you can practically operate it with one hand  the fold out screen is excellent and allows you to lift it up high  or down on the ground and still see what you are taking  conclusion  wide angle lens with 4x zoom  good to hold and excellent images  i will say this camera is a little slow to process you photos once taken and isn t great at focussing in  really  bad light summary well  i hope this information has been useful to you  this is the kind of review i was looking for when trying to decide what to purchase  if you are budding photo enthusiast and you take a lot of photos and like to experiment with your camera i would avoid the sony as it s very fiddly   just try it in a shop  it also has no fold out screen  which also means it could get scratched as it has a soft plastic cover  i take it this is the main difference why this camera is cheaper  all the other cameras are much nicer to handle although the 5700 is larger  i like to go out on my bike and take photos and the 5700 won t fit in a  large jacket waterproof  pocket whereas the others will  the olympus c5050 and canon g5 probably take the worst photos of the 5 due to noise and aliasing in the images  the nikons are more expensive but feel like good solid camera and have all the features you ll ever need  the nikon cameras are the most expensive  but you can get good comparative deals if you shop around  you ll read in a number of reviews that the 5400 low light focus is a little sketchy   although it has to be pretty low light  the thing that sells it is the wide angle  go out and takes some panorama shots with it  or interiors and you ll be sold my impressions of using the nikon 5400  i m very happy with the pictures from my 5400  granted it s a big leap up from the olympus model i had before  i m having great fun with time lapse photography  and shutter priority  metering is excellent on this camera  i ve had it a couple of weeks now and taken 1000 pictures and i still feel i m only scratching the surface of all the features  definitely get a 256mb card if you get one of these cameras  don t frustrate yourself with anything less copying 256mb onto a pc takes about 5 10 mins over usb  i think you can get flash readers which might be faster than this  it s still not a long time though considering the amount of data  my 540l would take 20 mins to do 16mb over the serial link you can pretty much work the 5400 with one hand  the dials are excellent and i wouldn t buy a camera that doesn t have dial mode selector after having my canon eos 1000f  i found the rear mounted cursor buttons too low  the rear controls should be further up the camera to be more comfortable with the buttons in an arc around the cursor  following the sweep of your thumb  the rubber grip is good though and it s comfortable to take lots of photos the fold out screen is a big plus  although a little small  i take it you have to compromise in order to have better battery life  if you are using the camera a lot in one day it ll be lucky to see the day out so you should invest in a second battery  these take 2 hours to fully charge with the charger provided software that comes with the camera is pretty good  the nikon view camera software is fully featured and scaleable  will work comfortably whatever the power of your pc  you can do just about anything to a photo with the photoshop elements package that it comes with  that s real fun and why digital photography is definitely the future  i have an hp5550 photo printer which gives great results as well  note  get a printer which prints full page as the 5550 has a white border  for best results you should go to a professional printers where they ll have 20 grand professional printer   you get better results enjoy nick ,comparison compare five camera settle

245,camera, my wife is an avid 35mm camera buff and is still not sold on digital photography  well i came across a good deal on a polaroid pdc 1300 camera and despite some shortcomings  i am quite impressed of what you get for the price first of all  windows xp users may be a bit frustrated  the camera will not work with the simple and easy to use  built in  digital camera software that works so well with scanners and other input devices  so  you have to install the polaroid software though a compatibility wizard  it installs but i was unable to use the usb cord  so i had to go with the much slower  seems like it  serial plug  a good solution would be to spend a little extra money and get a universal compactflash reader that works like a disk device in windows xp  makes it much easier now  on to the camera  it takes really good pictures  they are clear and crisp at all resolutions  the only bad picture i had was when i was taking pictures outside at dusk  they seemed to be quite dull  there isn t an adequate zoom on the camera  so you really have to move in to fill the frame  the lcd screen and the menu options work quite well and are an added bonus for the low cost to the camera  the included software is pretty basic but if basic is what you want  xp s software is much easier and faster to use  windows 95 98 me users will have no problems installing the software the camera consumes the batteries quite quickly  so be sure to turn it off when not in use  the lcd screen also eats a lot of power  when the batteries are low  there really is no warning and when you go to take a picture  it will flash and then turn off  i would recommend taking a pocketful of batteries with you on trips  it also includes a usb and serial cord  a protective case and an 8 meg card  i would recommend getting at least a 32 meg card  overall  if you can find this camera for under  200 00  it is a great price and very good for basic use  those wanting more features are better off with one with more  bells and whistles  ,wife aid mm camera buff still sell digital photography well come across good deal polaroid camera despite shortcomings quite impress get price first windows users may bite frustrate camera work simple easy use build digital camera software work well manners input devices install polaroid software though incompatibility wizard install unable use us cord go much slower seem like aerial plug good solution would spend little extra money get universal compactflash reader work like disk device windows make much easier camera take really good picture clear crisp resolutions bad picture take picture outside dusk seem quite dull adequate room camera really move fill frame lead screen menu option work quite well add bonus low cost camera include software pretty basic basic want software much easier faster use windows users problems instal software camera consume batteries quite quickly sure turn use lead screen also eat lot power batteries low really warn go take picture flash turn would recommend take pocketful batteries trip also include us aerial cord protective case meg card would recommend get least meg card overall find camera great price good basic use want feature better one bell whistle
246,camera, bristling with buttons  knobs  and dials  the new 5 2 megapixel minolta dimage 7 has a large  2 3 inch ccd and carries the highest optical resolution of any consumer digicam on the market today  so who needs it  any 3 megapixel camera at half the price lets you print photos at 8x10 inches or bigger  the question is do you really need this much power  the answer is yes if you want to blow up selected parts of your pictures without losing a significant amount of image quality  that s the main advantage of this silver and charcoal beauty  whose mix of metal and plastic gives it a high tech  professional look  but the dimage 7 has some annoying quirks  for one  the dimage 7 that i have frequently gave low battery warnings  and it stopped operating after only a few pictures had been taken  the battery compartment had to be opened and the four aa batteries jiggled until proper contact was re established  it also ran hot  after a dozen consecutive shots  the grip became uncomfortably warm for the thumb to rest upon  but regardless of heat  the dimage 7 captured pictures that looked dull unless they were first run through minolta s image viewer software  a needlessly time consuming extra step  my family found the images to be adequate and detailed but not quite up to par with those of other cheaper cameras even more annoying is that images on the electronic viewfinder  similar to those found on camcorders  are grainy  flickering  and lacking in detail it s not a true through the lens viewfinder  rather  it just poorly mimics the 1 8 inch lcd monitor  which works well enough on its own  finally  pictures taken in low light situations were consistently overexposed in the autoexposure mode until the compensation was adjusted to minus one  despite these shortcomings  the dimage 7 has many excellent features  including great documentation and easy operation  those intimidating looking buttons and dials actually put most of the controls at your fingertips instead of requiring a deep dive into a sea of menus  the aperture and shutter priority modes are a simple click press and set operation  as are the white balance  iso  up to 800  resolution  and compression modes  even the manual focus requires a simple push of a button push  then a turn of the ring at the base of the lens  and it s quick and accurate  a dedicated button lets you quickly revert to the camera s automatic program mode without fumbling around  the 7x optical zoom range  an excellent 28mm to 200mm equivalent  works by rotating an easy to grip rubberized ring  the shutter speeds are generous from 4 seconds to 1 2 000 of a second and a bulb setting allows exposures up to 30 seconds for night scenes or special effects  there are also 49mm threads on the lens that extend the dimage 7 s versatility by allowing you to add filters and auxiliary lenses  minolta s f 2 8 lens is more than up to the task of producing crisp  colorful  big images 13x17 inch prints were no sweat on an epson stylus photo 1200  since you ll be taking beefy 2mb images  on average  it s good that the memory card slot accepts compactflash type i and ii cards including the ibm microdrive  however  you ll need some heavy duty memory because the bundled 16mb card is incredibly inadequate  it may be burdened with a  1 500 list price  but minolta is off to a good start with the dimage 7  if you re looking for megaresolution in an easy to use  feature rich digicam  nothing else comes close  however  if pixel count isn t your focus  the olympus c 3040 zoom will cost you half as much and still provide quality 3 megapixel images  this camera just costs too much  ,bristle button knobs deal new megapixel minorca damage large inch cod carry highest optical resolution consumer

248,camera, the camera is so simple and easy to use  what a great way to get into a digital cameras  other camera seemed to bulky and ugly looking  this camera is so fun to use and good looking we bought a second one  when shopping for a digital camera the selection was rather dim  low end cameras had a attractive price  but very dismal picture quality  picture quality was important to me since the primary use of this camera was for online auctions and documenting college projects  but the cost of a high end camera was bank breaking  the canon attracted us since we already own the regular film canon elph  the ultra compact size was a huge buying point  other camera felt bulky and cumbersome  use this camera and it feels like a regular point and shoot  picture quality can be adjusted depending on your needs  i can usually get a good  rolls  worth of film on the stock flash cards  the camera has a very durable metal casing  the screen is small  but not too small  it feels perfect for the cameras mini size  this camera is so simple to use that i didn t even look at the instructions for a few weeks of constent use  if you can work a point and shoot camera  you can use this canon with ease  the canon comes with a handy little battery charger that is also small and compact  negatives  well battery life is alittle bit on the short side  reducing your battery consumption by turning of the lcd screen helps alot  the flash card they give you is far to small  a upgrade to 32 mb is well worth the extra money  also invest in a sandisk flashcard reader  it makes loading images on your computer very easy  much easier then getting a bunch of wires and plugging in your computer  the compact size is nice when you carry it in your pocket  but remeber to watch out for those fingers  on occasion they do get in the way  buy this camera  you won t feel ripped off because it feels well built  its easy to use   complete lack of instruction reading  its a pretty piece of metal  the pictures are great quality  and it has a good midrange pricing  i dont know why people would want anything else  ,camera simple easy use great way get digital camera camera seem bulky ugly look camera fun use good look buy second one shop digital camera selection rather dim low end camera attractive price dismal picture quality picture quality important since primary use camera online auction document college project cost high end camera bank break canon attract us since already regular film canon ultra compact size huge buy point camera felt bulky cumbersome use camera feel like regular point shoot picture quality adjust depend need usually get good roll worth film stock flash card camera unable metal cause screen small small feel perfect camera mind size camera simple use even look instructions weeks constant use work point shoot camera use canon ease canon come handy little battery charge also small compact negative well battery life little bite short side reduce battery consumption turn lead screen help clot flash card give far small upgrade mb well worth extra money also invest sand flashcard reader make load image computer easy much easier get bunch wire plug computer compact size nice carry pocket remember watch finger occasion get way buy camera feel grip feel well build easy use complete lack instruction read pretty piece metal picture great quality good midrange prick dont know people would want anything else
249,camera, this is a good digital camera for someone wanting to get into digital photography  it s easy to use  the shape and feel of the camera is very much like a traditional non digital point and shoot as you might expect from kodak  the images themselves are quite good the biggest downfall of this camera is that there s no optical zoom  the digital zoom is difficult to use  since it s not optical  you have to use the display screen when shooting with it to see what you ll really get   you can t tell by using the viewfinder  this makes it quite difficult for outdoor shots where the screen can be tough to see  the camera will also go through the battery power more quickly when using the display screen  and even at only 3x the zoom makes the picture quite grainy and pixelated  so i pretty much gave up on using it and considered it to be a camera with no zoom the dx3600 is not much more  but it does have an optical zoom   not much  but enough to make it much more useful than the 3500  my suggestion if you get this camera is to not use the zoom  even if it looks like it would make a better shot  instead  shoot without it  then crop the photo later on your pc  you ll avoid the pixelation problem  and if you shoot at the highest resolution  you ll still have a decent size photo  especially if it s for sharing via the web or e mail  but even small prints will be okay also be aware that replacing the batteries can get expensive  i suggest purchasing a charger and rechargable battery pack  that does  of course  offset one of the nice benefits of this camera   the price i used this camera for a few weeks then sold it on ebay and used the money for a dx3600  you can find both models regularly on ebay as factory refurbs  although most were probably never even used    but don t get too carried away with the bidding  as i ve seen some of them go for almost the price of new ones  ,good digital camera someone want get digital photography easy use shape feel camera much like traditional non digital point shoot might expect today image quite good biggest downfall camera optical room digital room difficult use since optical use display screen shoot see really get tell use viewfinder make quite difficult outdoor shots screen tough see camera also go battery power quickly use display screen even room make picture quite grain pixelated pretty much give use consider camera room much optical room much enough make much useful suggestion get camera use room even look like would make better shoot instead shoot without crop photo later pp avoid pixelation problem shoot highest resolution still decent size photo especially share via web mail even small print okay also aware replace batteries get expensive suggest purchase charge rechargable battery pack course offset one nice benefit camera price use camera weeks sell bay use money find model regularly bay factory return although probably never even use get carry away bid see go almost price new ones
250,camera, the other reviews have covered this camera quite well so i would just like to add a little bit of my own insight  1  bulk   the camera is a lot bulkier than most digitals  however i like the feel of a 35mm so this camera suites me well  if you want an easy to carry all around camera this is not it  however if you like the feel and heft of a traditional 35mm this camera might suite you too  2 the 2 5 inch lcd is awesome  my old 1 6 really stinks compared to this one  3  disks can be interchanged at anytime  i buy a 10 pack of mini cd r s and initialize all of them at once  they only take a few seconds each and then i have storage for about 600 to 3000 photo s depending on your resolution setting  4 what s with tiff  i don t know of any online store that will except tiff files and they are enormous  they should switch to raw if they want an uncompressed format on the camera  5 they don t really offer a wide array of lenses for the camera  just a few basics  for a serious amateur or pro this might be an issue  also you need an adapter ring to use them  6  the battery can t be charged outside the camera   unless you want to buy a special charger from sony for around  60  if you want a spare you have to take out the one in the camera then insert the spare to charge it  charging spare battery   pain in a  7  menu s are easy and logically laid out  it only takes a few minutes to master the menu s on this camera  sony has done an excellent job in this department otherwise i love the camera  it takes sharp clear images  and depending on the resolution setting it doesn t take that long to burn them to cd  this camera has a 4x cd drive  an 8x might be a nice improvement  battery life is good considering you are powering a mini computer  also i took a tip from another reviewer and bought some of those pda screen protectors  i cut it to fit over the lcd  works great  protects the lcd and images are still crystal clear  ,review cover camera quite well would like add little bite insight bulk camera lot bulkier digital however like feel mm camera suit well want easy carry around camera however like feel leave traditional mm camera might suite inch lead awesome old really stick compare one disk interchange daytime buy pack mind initiative take second storage photo depend resolution set stiff know online store except stiff file enormous switch raw want compress format camera really offer wide array lenses camera basis serious amateur pro might issue also need adapt ring use battery charge outside camera unless want buy special charge sonya around want spare take one camera insert spare charge charge spare battery pain menu easy logical lay take minutes master menu camera sonya do excellent job department otherwise love camera take sharp clear image depend resolution set take long burn camera drive might nice improvement battery life good consider lower mind computer also take tip another review buy pad screen protectors cut fit lead work great protect lead image still crystal clear

253,auto, in 1998 i became pregnant with my son  and immediately started looking for a new car  at the time we owned a 1994 geo metro  still have it  and my husband and i both agreed that it was not adequate to transport a child in safely  so i started hunting for an affordable car suitable for the transportation of a family i looked within our price range  which topped out at around 15 thousand dollars  i rounded my choices down to three  toyota corolla  chevrolet prizm and the chevrolet cavalier doing more research  i found out that the chevy prizm and the toyota corolla are made in the same factory in california  with the same dimensions and engine specifications  but the corolla ranged from 1 to 2 thousand dollars more in price than the prizm  so i cut out the corolla  and i went to test drive the cavalier and prizm after test driving both vehicles  i ultimately decided on the prizm  it was a smooth ride  easy to handle  quiet and peppy  while the cavalier had style and almost a race car type feel  it didn t afford much room  and the two door model cost the same as the prizm four door model i m a very picky car buyer  so i make the dealership bend over backwards to sell me a vehicle  i had them show me the engine  which had  in big bold letters across the block  quot toyota quot  lol  the kind of muffler  it s tire specs  etc etc  i was sold on the car  and bought it over the next two days that was back in august of 1998  the car is used mainly for mild travel about town with my son  who is now 13 months old  it gets great gas mileage  is still very comfortable and quiet  i bought a model with a manual transmission  and it is very easy to maneuver  and changes gears very smoothly  there is good head room for taller individuals  and all of the controls are easy to reach  the back seat is roomy  with three over the shoulder belts  there are also daytime running lights which i find very helpful  considering i live in a neighborhood heavily populated with children it s crash test ratings were some of the highest  right up there with volvo  subaru and ford models equal to it s size class  my insurance premiums were lower with the prizm than they would have been with the cavalier  even though they are in the same price class i don t recommend the automatic transmission for this car  they are generally bad on gas and more prone to problems in the long run  not to mention that they add a couple of thousand dollars onto the base price of a car  i tested the automatic  and it was rough and loud compared to the manual over all  this was a very good buy  it s easy to maintain  and the average fill up is around 12 dollars with regular unleaded gasoline br br  ,become pregnant son immediately start look new car time own go retro still husband agree adequate transport child safely start hunt unfordable car suitable transportation family look within price range top around thousand dollars round choice three tooth coolly chevrolet prize chevrolet cavalier research find prize tooth coolly make factory california dimension engine specification coolly range thousand dollars price prize cut coolly go test drive cavalier prize test drive vehicles ultimately decide prize smooth ride easy handle quiet puppy cavalier style almost race car type feel afford much room two door model cost prize four door model pick car buyer make leadership bend backwards sell vehicle show engine big bold letter across block quit tooth quit kind muffle tire speck etc sell car buy next two days back august car use mainly mild travel town son months old get great gas mileage still comfortable quiet buy model manual transmission easy maneuver change years smoothly good head room taller individuals control easy reach back seat room three shoulder belt also daytime run light find helpful consider live neighborhood heavily populate children crash test rat highest right vulvo sugar ford model equal size class insurance premium lower prize would cavalier even though price class recommend automatic transmission car generally bad gas prone problems long run mention add couple thousand dollars onto base price car test automatic rough loud compare manual good buy easy maintain average fill around dollars regular unload gasoline br
254,camera, the casio exilim ex s3 is the beginning of the new generation of digital cameras  combining compact size and image capacity  this is the digital camera to get size  the ex s3 is the first camera of its kind to be able to fit in a wallet  if you stack up 10 credit cards  you get the size of this camera  whenever i am on the go  i just slip it into my back pocket and i 146m gone  it also doesn 146t have any attachments  which gives you even less to carry  the exact dimensions are 89 5mm w  x 57mm h  x 11 7mm d  the lens is 7 1mm  which is in proportion to a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera  to add on to the amazingly small and efficient size of the camera  it is also as light as a feather  the camera weighs 72 grams  this camera doesn 146t have all of the add ons that you can get with a regular camera such as a tripod or different lenses  this guitar just has the bare necessities  if you need all of the other attachments  get a different camera images all of the ex s3 146s come with a dock that plugs into the computer through a usb input  while in the dock  the camera can be charged  or photos can be imported onto the computer  another thing that the ex s3 can do is take video  as you put your pictures onto the computer  they are saved as jpeg  dcf standard  or dpof compliant  when you put your video on the computer  it is saved as avi  motion jpeg  there are many image sizes  in pixels  that you can have  pictures can be 2 048 x 1 536  1 600 x 1 200  1 280 x 960 or  640 x 480  the movies can be 320 x 240  the maximum length of a movie is 30 seconds long  if you are bummed out about this and you want longer movies  then buy a camcorder  the camera has 3 2 megapixels  that equals 3 200 000 pixels  did you every wonder why the picture on the screen was so grainy  that is because of the digital zoom  the camera can zoom in or out 4x without the lens moving  when you put the pictures on the computer  the graininess will be completely gone  the zoom though is nothing like an optical zoom  which works much better memory one thing i like about the ex s3 is its memory  even though it only comes with 10mb of built in memory  you can buy compact flash cards for it  those can go from 32mb to a gig  about 1000mb  there is a chart on casio com where they show you how much space each type of picture can take up depending on resolution  and image size  pixels  other the ex s3 has 15 different recording modes  they are  1 portrait 2 scenery 3 portrait with scenery 4 coupling shot 5 pre shot 6 pet 7 flower 8 natural green 9 sundown 10 night scene 11 night scene portrait 12 fireworks 13 monochrome 14 retro 15 twilight  this camera also has built in flash  there are several flash modes you can have such as auto  flash on  flash off  or red eye reduction  there is also a timer so you can get into pictures that you took  you can make the timer countdown from 10 seconds or 2 seconds  the monitor on the camera is really nice  it is a 2 0 inch flat screen  tft color lcd  and has 84 960 pixels  354 x 240 bundles when you buy the camera  you get some accessories with it  but remember you only get the bare essentials  you get a rechargeable lithium ion battery  np 20  a usb cradle  to put the camera in  a special ac adaptor  a strap  a special usb cable  and a dummy card  you also get some software such as photo loader 2 1 for windows  photo loader 1 1 for macintosh  photohands 1 0 for windows  usb driver 1 0 for windows  and usb driver 2 1 for macintosh overall my overall opinion on this camera is if you are looking for a small camera that you can just put in your pocket and go  this is the one  if you are looking for a digital camera for business use  don 146t get this one  get a really good camera  i am not saying the ex s3 is a bad camera  i am just saying it is not something i would use for my job  also  if you don 146t need all of the little parts and numerous accessories  get this camera because this camera comes with only the essentials  this is definitely a recreational camera  a good one too  ,case exile ex begin new generation digital camera combine compact size image capacity digital camera get size ex first camera

255,camera, having always been interested in photography digital cameras had been on my wish list for some  quality of pictures and price kept me from buying a digital until this year when so many advances have been made and the price dropped to where its affordable  i bought the nikon coolpix 950  it had most of the features i wanted but was still a trade off  no one digital camera has every feature  i narrowed it down to the sony mavica and the nikon  the sony s big advantage was the use of floppies for picture storage  the nikon had optical viewing an well as the lcd screen  the coolpix has been a delight to work with after i learned all the features  check that i m still learning after almost a year  it has more features than i ll use  in the auto mode  which is the mode i started in  its point and shoot  gradually i learned to use some of the program modes with individual settings  the picture quality is excellent  i have been able to make excellent 8x10 s that are not distinguishable from good 35 mm s  color rendition to my eyes appears very accurate br br  ,always interest photography digital camera wish list quality picture price keep buy digital year many advance make price drop unfordable buy union coolpix feature want still trade one digital camera every feature narrow sonya mavra union sonya big advantage use flop picture storage union optical view well lead screen coolpix delight work learn feature check still learn almost year feature use auto mode mode start point shoot gradually learn use program modes individual settings picture quality excellent able make excellent indistinguishable good mm color condition eye appear accurate br

257,camera, the   fuji finepix 2800 zoom  is a digital camera with 2 1 megapixel ccd  which allows you shoot up to 1600x1200 resolution  and  unlike some digital camcorders that supposedly produce this kind of resolution with lower resolution ccds  this resolution is  real in other words  if you buy a digital camcorder that claims to produce 1600x1200 resolution from 1 3 megapixel ccd  e g  panasocic dv702  you cannot possibly get  real  1600x1200 resolution  1600x1200 resolution requires at least 1600x1200 b 1 920 000 pixels  b real  resolution and zoom  the finepix 2800 can produce  real  1600x1200 resolution and also features things like 6x optical and 2 5x digital zoom  it allows you also use 640x480 and 1280x960 resolutions b lcd  viewfinder and low light conditions  the camcorder has a 1 8  lcd and an electronic viewfinder  they are this camera s biggest drawback   both are barely visible in any kind of semi dark condition  which makes it impossible to see what you are shooting the lcd and viewfinder work fine with well illuminated scenes  but in low light conditions you cannot see anything on them  plus auto focus has issues in low light conditions  this camera is not for someone who wants to take pictures indoors  in medium to dark lighting b picture quality  the picture quality is excellent provided there is adequate light  there are no problems outdoors   with sunlight the picture quality is stunning  the camera is rated as iso 100  so expect to use flash a lot and due to the above mentioned lcd and evf problems as well as problems with auto focus in low light conditions  i have to once again mention that it is not the best choice for indoor shooting b features  the camera also has no tiff mode and the supplied smartmedia card is only 16 mb  the camera can shoot avi movies  up to 60 seconds with sound at 10 fps at 320x240 resolution  with pretty good quality  but the built in microphone is not that great  the camera features usb connection  has flash  you will need it  macro capability and auto focus  you can control exposure manually  in addition to ae modes  and the camera is easy to use  in general  the pictures can include your voice annotations of up to 30 seconds per picture  there is an automatic white balance mode as well as six other white balance modes the shutter speed is controlled from   to 1 1 500 second  the aperture is f2 8  f4 8 or f8 2  the auto focus can work in macro mode  from 3 9 inches to 2 6 feet  or regular mode  2 6 feet to infinity the built in flash has several settings you can use  auto  slow sync  red eye suppression  forced flash  the flash can reach 9 8 feet b batteries  the camera uses aa size batteries  4 alkaline batteries are included  but consumes them quickly with lcd on and doesn t show the battery status until they are almost empty  i suggest  if you get this camera  that you get rechargeable ni mh batteries and a charger   this last substantially longer that alkalines b what s included  i included are i camera 16 mb smartmedia card 4 alkaline aa size batteries usb cable manual cd rom with usb drivers and software shoulder strap and lens cap with strap b bottom line  i this camera is inexpensive and produces excellent picture quality in well lit conditions  but the low light performance is disappointing and the batteries are consumed quickly    ,full finepix room digital

258,auto, mercedes benz is a legendary name in the auto industry  renowned for its exceptional quality and engineering  but does that mean the three pointed star is immune to rolling out an occasional lemon  is it possible for mercedes benz to build a clunker yes virginia  m b is indeed capable of building a clunker  we know because we own one  we leased a new 1999 ml 320 in october  1998 and were immediately surprised by some very un mercedes like rattles  squeaks and shakes  the ml felt much looser than our other sport utility vehicle  a 1997 jeep grand cherokee  this came as something of a shock  considering how often mercedes is praised in the car magazines for its solid body structure and  vault like  feel after about a month  the rattles  squeaks and shakes were joined by a rushing wind noise from the rear hatch which grew steadily in intensity over the next few weeks until the interior of our vehicle at highway speeds sounded like a 747 blasting down the runway at full thrust  another surprise awaited us at the car wash  where the rear cargo compartment got thoroughly soaked because of the poor seal around the hatch door  good thing we weren t shlepping any groceries back there at the time  i don t have anything against wax beans  but i m not sure how tasty carnuba d veggies might be when we took the ml to the dealer to look at the problem  the service manager pointed out that the hatch door was sticking up about an inch above the roofline   has the vehicle been in a crash  he asked  adding that he had never seen such a badly misaligned door that wasn t the result of a collision  the dealer replaced the weather stripping around the hatch and realigned the door  which fixed the problem temporarily  the wind noise returned several months later  we were perplexed by the poor quality of our vehicle  but never having owned a mercedes before  we didn t know if the rattling was something that plagued all mls or just ours  then we drove the dealer s ml 320 loaner while ours was in the shop for the first of what would be many  many extended visits  we were astounded that the loaner had none of the shakes and rattles of our own vehicle  displaying the kind of surefooted composure one would expect in a mercedes  the difference was night and day  i should point out here that the loaner ml was the so called elegance version  which includes leather upholstery  a sunroof and other amenities  while our ml is the less expensive  classic version  with cloth seats and no sunroof  mechanically however  the two versions are identical we subsequently drove yet another dealer owned ml 320 elegance  which was also rattle free  why then did our ml rattle and squeak like a bad accordion in an oompah band  we concluded that our vehicle somehow slipped off m b s new assembly line in tuscaloosa  alabama without anyone catching the defect  it happens  any assembly line produces its share of defects and rejects  when you consider that m b was still working out the kinks in a brand new factory at the time our vehicle was built not to mention struggling to keep up with the surging demand for the m series it s not inconceivable that one shoddy specimen slipped through  but you will never get mercedes benz to admit that  a regional service manager sent to inspect our car concluded that the rattling was caused by defective door hinge hardware  which was replaced under warranty  the doors no longer rattle  but the rest of the body still does  the vehicle shudders violently when going over even modest potholes or bumps  the passenger side window now squeaks constantly and the dashboard shakes like ricky martin in la vida loca  another problem has been with the  check engine  light  which stayed illuminated for about six months while the dealer tried  and failed  repeatedly  to fix the engine sensor problem that caused the light to go on in the first place  it was finally fixed after about four or five trips to the dealer   we almost miss the warm  amber glow of the  check engine  light that has been our constant driving companion all these months  oh  and did i mention that one of the headlamps burned out after less than 40 000 kilometers  about 25 000 miles so naturally mercedes benz  keeper of the quality faith  immediately sent a team of experts to examine our vehicle in microscopic detail  in order to learn how such an aberration could possibly have passed out the factory gate  right  um  no  the idea that mercedes is somehow more genuinely concerned about quality than other corporations is a fantasy that we gullible folk in consumerland have been conditioned to believe by all the company s glossy advertising and careful cultivation of its brand cachet  the reality is that mercedes benz is an arrogant corporation that doesn t care any more about its customers than any other car company  which is to say it is happy to sell you a car  but if you have a problem  don t expect them to make it right  of course  the special treat in dealing with mercedes is that its employees have perfected the technique of looking down their noses at us hoi polloi arrivistes  who  now that the company has brought in reasonably priced vehicles  are able to join the ranks of mercedes owners for the first time  the attitude you get at the dealer is   so  you re one of the plebeians who can now afford our new  cheap mercedes  eh  just don t expect us to treat you with the same dignity we extend to our genteel clients who buy our elegant  100 000 cars yes  mercedes did offer a solution to our problem vehicle   we ll be happy to lease you a new car  they said  of course  they insist on making a killing in the process  when we pointed out that we feel cheated after paying full price for a defective vehicle  they said they would be happy to fix it  but not replace it  we now look forward to making a few dozen more trips to the dealer  maybe they wouldn t mind if i pitched a tent and sleeping bag in their showroom  seeing as i spend so much time there  it would just be so much more practical than commuting back and forth every day all in all  mercedes benz has some major work to do if it intends to compete effectively in the mid priced segment it is now pursuing with vehicles like the m series  the company s strategy of making its vehicles more affordable  and thereby reaching a broader market the new clk midsize coupe  and even the new flagship s series sedans cost thousands less than their immediate predecessors will not work if m b waters down the quality of its vehicles and the attentiveness of its service  people who pay a premium for the three pointed star don t want to be treated like second class citizens because they can finally afford to buy a moderately priced

259,camera, i received the casio qv 120 digital camera  as a gift in october 1999  i was quite excited since i had been wanting a digital camera for quite some time  i tend to think i am pretty high tech and can figure many electronic devices out without much trouble  this camera was pretty easy to maneuver the software was a cinch to install  i was warned before i used the camera that it would cost a fortune to keep it in picture taking capability  i honestly took it with a grain of salt  i was totally shocked when after taking just 24 pictures in about 10 minutes that the batter light started flashing  i thought to myself this has got to be a mistake  unfortunately it wasn t a mistake at all  i didn t even get to upload the pictures to my computer so i could edit and save them before the batteries conked out on me  at this point i had the regular duracell aa batteries installed  then i decided to switch to the new duracell high tech batteries  the new batteries are designed to be for high tech draining devices  such as digital cameras  cell phones  and portable music players  i am sorry to inform you  but the same problem occurred with these batteries  you can only take approximately 24 pictures before your batteries will die on you  if you upload pictures before you take 24 pictures then the batteries will conk out before the 24 pictures  it just varies how many pictures you take then upload the quality of the pictures could be a lot better in my opinion  i have to edit the color on all the pictures that i take  the camera does not have a built in flash  to me this should be a must on any camera manufactured  the camera also doesn t have a zoom function  it does have a 10 second timer that i absolutely love  it also has a function where you can protect a picture if you chooses to delete certain pictures after you have uploaded them  etc this camera is quite simple to use  but lacks major necessary features in my opinion  if you are traveling and want to take this camera along for some pictures  you can t forget to take your software  your laptop  and plenty of batteries  you can preview your pictures in the display area  but bewarned it looks totally different on your computer than it does on its screen  at first i did have some problems getting the pictures to save correctly  it does take quite some time to get the perfect picture that you thought you had taken to actually look halfway decent if you had better options than this camera  i would suggest any from the sony mavica line  i would definitely shop around before you make a purchase like this one  make sure the camera you want has all the features you are looking for  also anticipate any features you might need in the future good luck with your digital camera picture taking     ,receive case iv digital camera gift october quite excite since want digital camera quite time tend think pretty high teach figure many electronic devices without much trouble camera pretty easy maneuver software inch install warn use camera would cost fortune keep picture take capability honestly take grain salt totally shock take picture minutes matter light start flash think get mistake unfortunately mistake even get unload picture computer could edit save batteries cock point regular duracell batteries instal decide switch new duracell high teach batteries new batteries design high teach drain devices digital camera cell phone portable music players sorry inform problem occur batteries take approximately picture batteries die unload picture take picture batteries cook picture vary many picture take unload quality picture could lot better opinion edit color picture take camera build flash must camera manufacture camera also room function second time absolutely love also function protect picture choose delete certain picture unload etc camera quite simple use lack major necessary feature opinion travel want take camera along picture forget take software lawton plenty batteries review picture display area learn look totally different computer screen first problems get picture save correctly take quite time get perfect picture think take actually look halfway decent better option camera would suggest sonya mavra line would definitely shop around make purchase like one make sure camera want feature look also anticipate feature might need future good luck digital camera picture take

266,camera, why did i trade in my coolpix 950 for the 995  after owning and using the 950 for almost a year there were just a few shortcomings that irritated me to the point that i didn t enjoy using the camera anymore  so i realized that there were only a few options open to me  either dump it in my drawer and forget about it  only to be taken out when absolutely necessary  or trade it in for one of the newer generation of digital cameras while it was still worth something what exactly were those irritating traits i hear you ask  the number one failure for me was its dismal battery life  take a couple of pictures  scroll through your shots to decide which ones are keepers and which ones to delete  and before you know it  the screen is dead   due to a dead battery  the other main downfall for me was the way the nikon engineers had set up the options menu concerning the self timer and close up features  viz  that you could have the one or the other  but not both  this was a big no no for me as i especially needed the timer feature while taking highly magnified close up shots of watch movements  seeing as it s almost impossible to depress the shutter without even a tiny amount of camera movement  the timer feature would have come in handy had it been an option  well  it  was  an option  just not one to be used simultaneously with the close up feature fortunately a friend at work was keen on buying my 950  so now the prospect of getting the 995 was made much more affordable  the main reason that i didn t change brands  but decided to stick with the nikon  was that i absolutely loved the incredibly sharp and bright pictures of the former  regardless of whether they were taken in the regular mode or using macro so how does the 995 stack up against its older generation sibling  here is a brief rundown keeping in mind what my main uses of the camera are  which is for close ups of watches and watch parts and general family pictures b the good b picture quality is still excellent  with the added benefit of having 4x zoom versus 3x for the newer generation model   8mm to 32mm vs 7mm to 21mm  in the areas of sharpness  contrast  definition and saturation of colors  it seems to be at least as good as the 950  which had an excellent reputation for being outstanding in those areas  to be honest  i can t really tell if one is better than the other as i would need a professional quality printer to be able to give you an absolute answer  my printer  a new canon s300   2400 x 1200 dpi   is only good enough to show me that they seem to be at least comparable  and certainly excellent enough to satisfy the most demanding users  macro is unchanged  still an amazing 2cm is the closest focusing distance  flash is now a pop up unit so red eye  while not entirely eliminated  is greatly reduced  the pop up style flash also has the added advantage in that it is automatically off until you deliberately pop it up  the push and rotate set up to access the different menus and options is very easy  logical and straightforward to use  and  oh yes  battery life has been greatly extended  about two hours of continuous use versus about 10 minutes for its predecessor while i wish that nikon would put in a separate button or switch for the self timer  at least now one can use the close up feature together with it  the downside being that the self timer only operates in the close up mode which means that the auto focusing is much finer and hence slower versus the regular modes the quick review function is really handy  especially considering the delay between the time the shutter is pressed and the picture is actually taken  so one can see whether one made the shot or not  and if so whether it s a keeper or not b the bad b no complaints from me this time about inadequate documentation  this is a company that obviously listens to their customers  the instruction booklet is complete  and for those requiring larger print  the complete manual is available on the supplied cdrom  while i was amazed at the brightness and resolution of the 950 s viewing screen  i m not too enthusiastic about the one on the 995  not only is it a little smaller   4 7cm versus 5cm   but a lot less bright and  regardless of how i adjust the viewing options  lower resolution  especially in low light conditions  oh well  i guess that s the price users have to pay for the greatly extended battery life  i have a sneaking suspicion that that the amazing viewing screen was the main culprit for the 950 s dismal battery life this is still not a camera for sports aficionados  due to the delay from the time the shutter is released till the time the shot is actually taken  in fact  there is still so much lag that one will probably find this camera inadequate for candid shots  especially if your children are anywhere near as active as mine  i honestly don t think that this is just a shortcoming of nikon digital cameras in general  or this one in particular  but of all digital cameras  due to the way they work  i think that it will be a few more years before digital cameras will be able to match regular film cameras in the area of speed  when you see the sports action photographers going digital  then you ll know that they ve overcome that weakness the viewfinder is still not much to write home about  but i realize that if nikon were to give it a true through the lens viewfinder  both the cost and size would increase dramatically this final criticism is not really a serious one  but now one has so many options that when one scrolls through the different menus some have more than one page  read the instructions and just practice going through them to get comfortable and familiar with all of them and how to switch between them  in order to see how intuitive the camera is to use  i managed to figure them all out without reading the instruction booklet  to all of my friends and family whom i have chided in the past for not reading the instructions  i humbly apologize  as the saying goes  when all else fails  read the instructions b the ugly b while still not an attractive camera by any means   the canon elph wins that award hands down   the swivel feature definitely makes the camera easier to hold firmly and minimizes its bulk while not in use  the 995 doesn t have the same metal body as the 950  so it does give the impression of being less solidly built than the latter  although my experience has been that the polycarbonate type of plastics that the camera manufacturers use is very tough  on the plus side it does have the added advantage of reducing the cameras weight b a few important manufacturers specifications b i ccd i  28 5mm ccd capable of 3 34 million pixels i image size i  640x480  vga

rechargeable li ion   supplied with both one battery and the charger  which doubles as an ac adaptor  final thoughts b although the 995 comes with a usb cable to hook it up directly to one s comp  i still prefer to use a card reader as it frees up the camera for other uses  coupled with the fact that i don t need to deplete the camera s battery or hook up the ac adaptor  as i mentioned in my 950 review  even although the prices of mega storage cards have fallen dramatically  i m still not a fan of them for the reasons given  i use either a 16mb or 32mb compact flash card  maybe i would be more keen on them if i printed larger photos  as i don t print anything larger than 8  x 10  i don t need the higher resolution  hence no need for massive storage cards  all in all i m very happy with my purchase and even although i miss the incredible clarity of the 950 s viewing screen  i m pleased that i made the upgrade  email me for any further questions or comments  gary  ,trade coolpix own

268,auto, although i have not yet purchased the lx470  i have completed my research and it s down to a few last details  price  color verification etc basically  i really liked the 2000 lx470  but i hated the exterior colors  today i got a call from the dealership informing me that they just received the information on the 2001 and that it is going to be available in blue  the color i want  i haven t seen the actual blue yet  and i admit that there are a number of good blues and a number of not so good blues  i m hoping that it s the same blue as was available on the 1999 sc200  a little bit brighter than cobalt but a very clean pure blue in a metallic paint  this is the most beautiful exterior color i ve seen on a car everything else about the lx470 is top notch  the ride is perfection the handling is excellent  and the acceleration is phenomenal for a vehicle of it s size  the lx470 provides excellent positive feedback and road awareness  although somehow  it does insulate you from the acceleration sensations  both in cornering  and in forward accelerations i m told that the 2001 is going to be substantially the same as the 2000 but the sound system has been upgraded to mark levinson  a navigation system is now available  and the colors are changing lexus reputation for quality and reliability can t be beat  and this is no exception  the car is perfectly put together and i couldn t find a single flaw in any of the models i examined at the various dealerships i ve travelled to  everyone i ve talked to who has one is very happy with it and i have yet to meet a lexus owner who has had any significant problems with their lexus  yes  i know several lexus owners it s pricey  but if i can negotiate out the door just under msrp  i think it s good value for the money br br  ,although yet purchase complete research last detail price color purification etc basically really like hat exterior color today get call leadership inform receive information go available blue color want see actual blue yet admit number good blue number good blue hop blue available little bite brighter coat clean pure blue metallic paint beautiful exterior color see car everything else top notch ride perfection handle excellent acceleration phenomena vehicle size provide excellent positive feedback road awareness although somehow insulate acceleration sensations cover forward accelerations tell go substantially sound system upgrade mark levinson navigation system available color change plexus reputation quality reliability beat exception car perfectly put together find single flaw model examine various dealerships travel everyone talk one happy yet meet plexus owner significant problems plexus yes know several plexus owners price negotiate door think good value money br
269,camera, i bought the sony dsc p9 while staying in korea during the world cup  and i must admit its really fancy  after the initial charging of the included battery  i had tons of fun trying out the p9 s many features  especially the movie aspect let me start off by telling you the picture quality  you have many to choose from  but because the included 16mb memory stick was small  i didnt use the maximum setting because when i did  i was only able to fit in about 12 pics  but setting the camera 1280x960 i was able to fit in 33 pictures  which is ok  and the quality is very decent as well  the menu settings allow you to have a lot of control over what you want  although you can t manually set the aperture setting  but that s ok  because this camera was meant for people like me  who don t know or even want to know how to manually set these things the night shot works ok  i did have some trouble at first  but overall  the camera did work well in very dark situations  you just have to remember to hold the camera very still  since the lens is open for a longer period of time  which means that any type of movement will distort the image the flash is very bright  but it does take the camera a bit longer than i would like for it to recharge inbetween taking pictures  roughly 4 6 seconds  sometimes up to 10  depending on how much battery power you have left  also  the flash eats the battery power very quickly  the zoom on the camera which is digital 6x  works very well  better than i have seen on most digital cameras within this range  now onto the fun stuff  the moving pictures portion for the camera is really good  you can take full motion movies at 320x240  and unlike many other cameras  you can make as long as the movie you want with sound up to the storage space on the memory stick  with the included memory stick  you can get 11 minutes worth  although the quality isn t that great but it is fun to use at times  another nice feature is the multishot in lieu of the movie  this is where the camera will take a series of pictures with one click  it s really fun to play with now the casing of the camera is really great  it feels solid in my hand and unlike other cameras that have the plasticy feel  this one is more rugged because of its aluminum alloy body  it s light yet sturdy  and it can take a beating  i dropped my camera a few times during some heated moments at the world cup  but it kept on going  although i don t suggest you do this  of course a great feature of all digital cameras is the lcd display  the p 9 sports a great 1 5  lcd that is bright and crisp even in the outdoors where most other cameras seem to washout  the navigation is done by a rocker button  which can be a hassle for anyone with big fingers  but it ultimately is a great piece of design  the only down fall i have with the lcd is that it isn t a touchscreen  when reviewing pictures  you are able to zoom into the picture and edit on board such as cropping  rotating and zooming in and out of the picture all within the camera  the clarity even at 1280x960 is unbeleivable  i took a picture of some history tablets while visiting the museums  and using the zoom i was able to read every single word in the picture  without having to take pictures of each section  that was really great the camera is unbeleivable especially when using a 128mb memory stick  i am able to fit over 300 pictures at the 1280x960 mode  and 112 at the highest setting which is 2392x1400  i generally use the landscape mode this is one great camera  i ve taken a look at other 4 megapixel cameras and but this was the only one that had a great design  and sturdy feel  i tried the minolta which looks similar to the p 9  but it felt weak  and it felt as if i would have to be very careful when taking pictures  which isn t always the case sony has done great things with the dsc p series of camera s and they know when they have a killer design along with fantastic features  and this one is no different  the 4 megapixel quality should last for a few years  and i know it will last  since i put it through the battles of the world cup  ,buy sonya duc stay world cup must admit really fancy initial charge include battery tons fun try many feature especially movie aspect let start tell picture quality many choose include mb memory stick small use maximum set able fit pick set camera able fit picture ok quality decent well menu settings allow lot control want although mentally set aperture set ok camera mean people like know even want know mentally set things night shoot work ok trouble first overall camera work well dark situations remember hold camera still since lens open longer period time mean type movement distort image flash bright take camera bite longer would like charge take picture roughly second sometimes depend much battery power leave also flash eat battery power quickly room camera digital work well better see digital camera within range onto fun stuff move picture portion camera really good take full motion move unlike many camera make long movie want sound storage space memory stick include memory stick get minutes worth although quality

270,auto, recently consumers union released an opinion on the mitsubishi montero limited  of course like any consumer i was initially concerned with their findings  especially because i drive a 2001 montero limited  but it s not just me  i usually have my four children in tow  their ages range from 10 months to 7 years upon viewing the video of how the montero went up on two wheels  it became abundantly clear that we as consumers need to depend more on opinions we read on the internet  from real live people with real live experiences  i mean  really  who drives their suv like that anyway  if you drive any suv like that something bad is bound to happen  well mine is a real life experience  i absolutely love my montero  everyday i place my four children in it and every week i drive anywhere from 250 300 miles commuting from work and the sitters  i am a very aggressive driver and i have never felt uneasy or unsure of what my car could handle  in the heavy rain i feel perfectly safe and sound  in the summer heat it is one of the most comfortable places to be  in fact last summer when i was still pregnant with my baby  i found the car was the only place i could sit comfortably  we sometimes took long drives just so i could get a nap in  as for the sun roof  it is so big  even the people in the back can enjoy the view  especially on night drives  altogether the mitsubishi montero limited is a great buy  it s luxurious  sporty practical  and most of all safe  i recommend you head out to your local mitsubishi dealer and ask to test drive the montero limited  but don t be surprised if you drive it all the way home  ,recently consumers union release opinion mitsubishi monster limit course like consumer initially concern find especially drive monster limit usually four children tow age range months years upon view video monster go two wheel become abundantly clear consumers need depend opinions read internet real live people real live experience mean really drive sun like anyway drive sun like something bad bind happen well mine real life experience absolutely love monster everyday place four children every week drive anywhere miles commute work sisters aggressive driver never felt uneasy ensure car could handle heavy rain feel perfectly safe sound summer heat one comfortable place fact last summer still pregnant baby find car place could sit comfortably sometimes take long drive could get nap sun roof big even people back enjoy view especially night drive altogether mitsubishi monster limit great buy luxurious sport practical safe recommend head local mitsubishi dealer ask test drive monster limit surprise drive way home
271,camera, i recently purchased a canon d60 camera with 2 usm lenses the 28 80 ef usm and the 70 300ef usm the only edition that i will probably add is the 17 35 tamron due to the price  over the canon lense the camera has a learning curve so if you think you can just run and use it to it full extent don t kid yourself download the user manual and read it first  i ordered mine in may and it arrived in sept i also as of yesterday purchased a canon eos elan 7e as my film camera  uses all the same stuff except the battery i shot quite a few pictures in the last couple of weks and they are great  but you must add a better flash for those darker pictures the 420ex works fine  note i was talked into a sunpack unit the 4000 which had more power and was cheaper by the salesman who i have relied on for more than 30 yrs  but the unit didn t work it was ttl and the canon eos d60 uses ettl only so it didn t work on that camera but it did work on the rebel series just fine  it would track the zoom but the unit would not fire in any mode including manual so take that into account you must use their flash as of this writing  the pc outlet worked fine with my standard candlestick sunpack but even with the hot shoe adapter the flash wouldn t work i looked at and was going to the store to buy the fuji s2 pro when i was told mine had just arrived  the thing i do not like about the fuji is the 2 battery style cr123a and 4 aa batteries  also reports were jaggies when items are 45 degrees the camera of course is big just like a real 35 mm slr the elan 7e is noticably lighter but the digital for most work is great picture size in the jpeg format in the very best mode is about 1 5 meg average so be ready for using at least 128 meg cards and get the kit one with the battery charger etc all in all the camera is great and i feel it is better than the fuji and the d100 as i use a n 80 nikon at work and i am not really pleased with the number of times it misses the proper focus good luck hope this review helps  ,recently purchase canon camera us lenses us us edition probably add baron due price canon sense camera learn curve think run use full extent kid download user manual read first order mine may arrive sept also yesterday purchase canon os plan film camera use stuff except battery shoot quite picture last couple weeks great must add better flash darker picture ex work fine note talk unpack unit power cheaper salesman rely yes unit work til canon os use tell work camera work rebel series fine would track room unit would fire mode include manual take account must use flash write pp outlet work fine standard candlestick unpack even hot shoe adapt flash work look go store buy full pro tell mine arrive thing like full battery style batteries also report maggie items degrees camera course big like real mm sir plan noticeably lighter digital work great picture size peg format best mode meg average ready use least meg card get kit one battery charge etc camera great feel better full use union work really please number time miss proper focus good luck hope review help
272,auto, as i wrote in my earlier opinion hondas are built to last  i said that when i decided to by a new car  it would be an accord  well  two weeks ago i did just that  i knew that i couldn t go wrong buying another honda  my civic provided me with 11 great years and 216 000 miles of service and i was sad to see it go  but i knew it was time  i did get teary eyed when i had to sign the papers trading it in  my friends said they would miss that car as much as i did  i was told that when i did get a new honda  it would have to be the same color  blue  that my civic was  i went to the honda dealership when i had purchased my civic  i test drove a beige accord that was a demo car  i liked it  but it didn t feel like me  then i saw a silver accord with blue interior  i got in  drove it and knew that this was the car for me  one reason i decided on an accord was that i am getting older  not old  mind you  but older  my friends and i are getting too old to climb in the back seat  hence a four door car  another reason i got an accord was that it makes taking both my grandfather smith and my grandma cowan places easier for them  it was getting especially difficult for grandma to get in and out of my car since she broke her hip  my civic was too low to the ground  and the accord is just right for both of my grandparents to get in and out of with ease  i also just wanted a bigger car  with a lot of friends having children now  i knew at some point i would be asked to baby sit or to take them places and i knew a four door car was in order  i know it has only been two weeks now  but i love this car  both the front and back seats are roomy  i also like the compartments that are the accord  the arm rest in the front seat has two compartments  one for loose change  and if you lift it up  there is another  bigger place to keep things like cd s  pens  gum and other miscellaneous stuff that i used to keep on the front seat of my civic  the car handles like a dream  the engine is quiet and smooth  one feature i discovered by accident is that if you leave the key in the ignition  you can t lock the driver side door  the key has to be out before you can lock the doors  that will come in handy for me  i have locked my keys in the car on more than one occasion  the accord has both driver and passenger air bags  also  you can t start the car unless your foot is on the brake pedal  you also can t take it out of park unless you have the key in the ignition  in my opinion  this is probably one of the safest cars on the market today  if you are thinking about getting a new car  you can t go wrong buying a honda     ,write earlier opinion hand build last say decide new car would accord well two weeks ago know go wrong buy another hand civic provide great years miles service sad see go know time get tear eye sign paper trade friends say would miss car much tell get new hand would color blue civic go hand leadership purchase civic test drive beige accord domo car like feel like saw silver accord blue interior get drive know car one reason decide accord get older old mind older friends get old climb back seat hence four door car another reason get accord make take grandfather smith grand coman place easier get especially difficult grand get car since break hip civic low grind accord right grandparents get ease also want bigger car lot friends children know point would ask baby sit take place know four door car order know two weeks love car front back seat room also like compartments accord arm rest front seat two compartments one loose change lift another bigger place keep things like pen gum miscellaneous stuff use keep front seat civic car candle like dream engine quiet smooth one feature discover accident leave key munition lock driver side door key lock doors come handy lock key car one occasion accord driver passenger air bag also start car unless foot brake pedal also take park unless key munition opinion probably one safest cars market today think get new car go wrong buy hand
273,camera, i ve had my dc 260 for almost a year now  overall  i thinks it a great camera  i still keep finding great uses for it  i ve taken over 5000 pictures with it in that time  a few weeks ago  i  quot discovered quot  the time lapse feature  i ve created some great avi s of sun rises and sunsets in the smoky mountains on vacation this cameras has a lot of bells and whistles  one simple example is when you take a picture in portrait mode  with the camera rotated 90 degrees the image is automatically rotated  there is no needed to rotate in photoshop  i played around with a friend s olympus c2000 and was amazed that this new camera wouldn t do the same  we had to rotated the images in an photo editing program the resolution is what set it apart  1536x1024 from other cameras at the time i purchased  also  since it uses compact flash i can plug the cf card into an adapter and slide it right into my laptop  the cf card mounts as a drive and i can copy pictures extremely fast  just remember  serial is like a bicycle  usb is like a motor cycle and plugging into a pcmcia slot is like a rocket i would highly recommend that you purchase a 48 mb or great cf card  the 8 mb card  just isn t enough  it s good enough for about 18 high resolution  high quality pictures with my 48mb card  i can get about 100 high resolution  high quality pictures  these look fantastic when printed on a nice printer the 3x optical zoom is nice  but it would be nice if this were more like 5x  that s really my main complaint after owning this camera for a year here are the negatives     the lcd display eats batteries  it s not needed since there is a view finder    rechargable nickel metal hydride batteries are needed   comes standard on newer cameras    3x optical zoom is sometimes not enough br br  ,almost year overall think great camera still keep find great use take picture time weeks ago quit discover quit time lapse feature create great vi sun rise sunset smoke mountains vacation camera lot bell whistle one simple example take picture portrait mode camera rotate degrees image automatically rotate need rotate photoshop play around friend polypus amaze new camera rotate image photo edit program resolution set apart camera time purchase also since use compact flash plug cf card adapt slide right lawton cf card mount drive copy picture extremely fast remember aerial like bicycle us like motor cycle plug acacia slot like rocket would highly recommend purchase mb great cf card mb card enough good enough high resolution high quality picture mb card get high resolution high quality picture look fantastic print nice printer optical room nice would nice like really main complaint own camera year negative lead display eat batteries need since view finder rechargable nickel metal hydrate batteries need come standard newer camera optical room sometimes enough br

278,camera, i bought my olympus c2020 zoom digital camera in late january  2000 for about  900  after adding a strap to prevent lens cap loss  i ve lost 2 so far even with the strap  a battery charger  and an extra memory card  my total cost was over  1050  lots of features i m still learning to use them all  it s great to not worry about wasting a lot of film  i just erase  bad  pictures   shoot away  am getting pretty good results  see http community webshots com user melhouse1 for examples  even using the camera s programmed settings  good  sharp detail in macro mode as well  the camera s small size makes it convenient to take along  but it has some minor design flaws  some of which have been fixed in the newer c3000 line   c4000 line of this camera  these flaws include  1  easily lost lens cap  i ve only lost one so far   it cost  18 to replace  2  neck strap attachment rings in a bad position  so when worn around the neck  the camera tips  up  rather than sitting comfortably against the chest  3  some camera features require scrolling through several menus to access or are  difficult to find  in the menus  4  no usb  my printer has a built in memory card reader  so this isn t really a problem for me  have had instances where the camera does not properly register color particularly when attempting to photograph close ups or bunches of red flowers  such as roses  carnations  begonias  etc  or in incandescent light although later versions of this camera supposedly have improved color processing  have found that it s a bit inconvenient   awkward to have to use an adapter ring in order to use filters  i also feel this ring should have come standard with the camera  rather than as an add on  overall  though  i m happy with the camera   when the  new  improved  versions of this camera come down in price  i m giving this one to my daughter   getting a newer model  ,buy polypus room digital camera late january add strap prevent lens cap loss lose far even strap battery charge extra memory card total cost lot feature still learn use great worry waste lot film ease bad picture shoot away get pretty good result see http community webshots com user melhouse examples even use camera programme settings good sharp detail micro mode well camera small size make convenient take along minor design flaw fix newer line camera flaw include easily lose lens cap lose one far cost replace neck strap attachment ring bad position wear around neck camera tip rather sit comfortably chest camera feature require stroll several venus access difficult find venus us printer build memory card reader really problem instance camera properly register color particularly attempt photograph close bunch red flower roses variations begonias etc incandescent light although later versions camera supposedly improve color process find bite inconvenient awkward use adapt ring order use filter also feel ring come standard camera rather add overall though happy camera new improve versions camera come price give one daughter get newer model
279,camera, i bought this camera because i just had my first son adn thought this would be the easiest way to get his new pictures out to relatives in a short period of time  what i didn t take into effect is focusing  this camera sucks for focusing and when you put it on your computer you totally need to render the photo to make it photo quality that will look good on your printer  and even with rendering the pictures are usually still all blurry and tend to be too grainy anyway here are my chief complaints 1  the view finder screen makes focusing manually impossible given the terrible resolution of the screen 2  in the dark you are completely screwed unless you have some sort of large light with which to light your subject yes there is a flash but its no good unless your image is focused and yes the autofocus has no idea what to do with a dark subject  the flash tends to make the pictures way too bright also 3  the battery life is pathetic  each disk holds 40 pictures  the only problem is the battery usually doesn t last through all of them the good things about the mavica are 1  the disc combatability although i m not quite sure why they don t go all out to the memory stick as sony keeps saying they want to do overall i guess the newer mavica s are better but they still rely on bad focusing technology which inevitably limits the mavica s usefulness to the point of saying thanks but no thanks br br  ,buy camera first son think would easiest way get new picture relatives short period time take effect rouse camera suck rouse put computer totally need render photo make photo quality look good printer even render picture usually still flurry tend grain anyway chief complaints view finder screen make rouse mentally impossible give terrible resolution screen dark completely screw unless sort large light light subject yes flash good unless image focus yes autofocus idea dark subject flash tend make picture way bright also battery life pathetic disk hold picture problem battery usually last good things mavra disc combatability although quite sure go memory stick sonya keep say want overall guess newer mavra better still rely bad rouse technology inevitably limit mavra usefulness point say thank thank br

281,camera, after researching a ton of digital cameras my husband called me and said hsn had this one on and to take a look at it  i was a little leary as i have had problems with 2 other digital cameras and them working with my emachines computer and windows me  i thought well i won t know till i try it i was pleasantly surprised when the installation went without a hitch from installing software to taking pictures  i was looking for a 2 megapixel camera for pics of our family that i could enlarge up to an 8 x 10 with 35 mm quality this is it  i usually take pics without the screen on as this does drain the batteries faster  i have not found a problem with the batteries draining fast with regular usage and using the viewfinder  the menu screen is very easy to use  a matter of using arrows which i hope we all understand  the top of the camera is very simple to understand it has an icon for taking a picture  one for viewing the pic and one for video not difficult at all  the camera is lightweight and perfect for my hand as well as that of my husband who has large hands  our daughter  almost 4 yrs old  takes pics for me and they are beautiful  she knows that when the light is green to take the pic and when it is orange to wait a matter of seconds  the self timer is a nice addition as we often want a family pic taken and no one around to take it  i have recently used this in the rain on our daughter s field trip altho i wouldn t recommend getting it too wet  the rain was coming down and it was dark and miserable and the pics are beautiful the colors stand out wonderfully the memory cards are not expensive any more  mine came with a 16 mb card i believe and i can take 100 pics on it i always take pics in the fine resolution so i can get the best photo quality out of each shot  it is nice to have removable memory as you can buy as big or small memory as you need ex 8 mg or 128 mb  i am planning on buying a 16 or 32 mb card as a backup so i can continue shooting without having to delete any pics i also like the fact that there is no double pressing the button to take the pic  some digitals require you to press and hold or press twice  this one you press and hold if you want to or just press and it takes the shot the only thing i had trouble with at first is taking pics without any shake  my regular 35 mm camera is bulky so i was used to that weight  however  after maybe 3 shots that were shaky my pics began to get better and better with no shake whatsoever  i have used the digital zoom to look at the pictures on the screen but haven t developed any that i have left in the zoom mode as i am usually close enough to the subject or background i am taking a picture of i have uploaded pictures to walmart on their website and had the exact same pictures developed off of my memory card to see if the photo quality is the same  i thought that the walmart ones would be nice in case i am not up to going out 8 mos pg and with a 4 yr old  i must say that the uploaded pics were the same quality as the ones directly off my memory  the only difference is if you take the memory in with you the photo people can brighten  darken or balance any colors in the picture which is nice if you are enlarging them etc  unfortunately  i have had my camera fall of my desk about 5 times and so far not a scratch no problem with the camera at all i have used the movie section a few times and loved it takes a few minutes to upload the video but it is great the only thing i can think of as a con is not really a con i tend to take too many pictures and then figuring out the cost of 100 pics thank goodness the prices have come down to about  26 cents a picture fuji is known for their film quality and their digital camera quality as far as color  depth etc  they definitely out did themselves on this camera  ,search ton digital camera husband call say one take look little weary problems digital camera work machine computer windows think well know till try pleasantly surprise installation go without pitch instal software take picture look megapixel camera pick family could enlarge mm quality usually take pick without screen drain batteries faster find problem batteries drain fast regular usage use viewfinder menu screen easy use matter use arrows hope understand top camera simple understand icon take picture one view pick one video difficult camera lightweight perfect hand well husband large hand daughter almost yes old take pick beautiful know light green take pick orange wait matter second self time nice addition often want family pick take one around take recently use rain daughter field trip also recommend get wet rain come dark miserable pick beautiful color stand wonderfully memory card expensive mine come mb card believe take pick always take pick fine resolution get best photo quality shoot nice removable memory buy big small memory need ex mb plan buy mb card back continue shoot without delete pick also like fact double press button take pick digital require press hold press twice one press hold want press take shoot thing trouble first take pick without shake regular mm camera bulky use weight however maybe shots shake pick begin get better better shake whatsoever use digital room look picture screen develop leave room mode usually close enough subject background take picture unload picture palmar webster exact picture develop memory card see photo quality think palmar ones would nice case go pg old must say unload pick quality ones directly memory difference take memory photo people brighten darker balance color picture nice enlarge etc unfortunately camera fall desk time far scratch problem camera use movie section time love take minutes unload video great thing think con really con tend take many picture fire cost pick thank goodness price come cents picture full know film quality digital camera quality far color depth etc definitely camera
282,auto, i bought my 1990 galant gs in may of 1990 from dobbs brothers mitsubishi in memphis  tn  the car was virtually identical to the model that had won the 1989 motor trend import car of the year award  the 4 door sedan i purchased was equipped with a 2 0 liter  16 valve  dohc engine that produced 130 hp  the transmission was a 5 speed manual  features included driver adjustable suspension  am fm stereo cassette  a c  and  quot sport seats quot  the car was marketed as a sports sedan  and was highly touted by the automotive press  i very nearly bought a taurus or camry  but i really wanted a more sporty car with a 5 speed stick when my galant was relatively new  and before the constant problems started  this vehicle was a joy to drive  it looked good  felt good  and made me feel smart for having purchased it  the ride was fairly quiet  and the engine accelerated smoothly almost to the 7000 rpm redline the first problems didn t bother me at all  for instance  in the first year a vacuum hose problem caused the fancy suspension system to fail  but this was easily repaired  i always strictly followed the maintenance schedule specified by the owner s manual  dobbs mitsubishi performed all routine maintenance with the exception of oil changes  which were done quarterly at various 15 minute oil change shops i thought it was unusual when the battery went dead  in my second year of ownership  the inside dome light had been on all night  because one of the doors did not shut completely  this caused the battery to go completely dead  it turns out that mitsubishi had installed extremely cheap batteries as standard equipment  no  they were not covered by the vehicle warranty  3 years 50 000 miles  i bought myself a big  heavy 5 year battery at autozone that was about twice the size of the original battery my first major problem occurred at about 53 000 miles  in 1993  the car went completely dead one saturday morning when i was about a mile from home  on monday the dobbs repair shop called to tell me that my timing belt had broken  and it had caused severe damage to the engine  they estimated repairs to be in the  2000 3000 range   incidentally  the owner s manual specified that timing belts on the galant did not require replacement until 60 000 miles  however  they offered to rebuild the valves cylinders as a warranty job  for free  if i would let them keep the car for 10 14 days  and use the repair job as a teaching tool  naturally  i quickly and gratefully accepted that offer  i continued my strict observance of the published maintenance schedule the next major problem happened at 97 000 miles when the second timing belt broke  this second belt had lasted only 44 000 miles  the dobbs repair shop informed me that i would need a new engine  which they would provide for  5 000  they would only consider putting in a brand new engine  by this time the car  even if repaired to perfection  was not worth  5 000  i argued that the damage should have been covered by warranty because the timing belt was still 16 000 miles shy of being due for replacement  neither dobbs nor mitsubishi corporate felt bound by the guidelines published in the vehicle maintenance schedule i strongly suspected that dobbs was trying to pressure me into trading for a new car  i refused  seeing no point in ever again using dobbs  or mitsubishi s services  i had the car towed to metric motors  an independent repair shop  after several days of looking  they located a used 2 0 liter dohc mitsubishi engine  which they installed for me for about  2200 total  the car was running  but it would never quite be the same again  the last few years of ownership were a constant battle with oil leaks  unstable engine idle settings  smoking exhaust  fear of broken timing belts  which we changed every 18 months or 30 000 miles  on board computer failure  and electrical failures that included a battery explosion  i kept the galant for 9 years and 140 000  miles  an indication of my stubbornness  rather than quality or reliability of the vehicle  in case you had a doubt  i will never buy from another dobbs owned dealership again  neither will i purchase another mitsubishi automobile again  i ll steer clear of their tv s  vcr s  and other gear  too note  most galants sold in 1990 were the ls variety with a sohc engine  pi suspect the ls models had much better reliability than the gs  mitsubishi sold a lot of early 1990s eclipses that had the same dohc engine as my galant  i have observed that very  very few were still on the road just a few years later br br  ,buy galant may brothers mitsubishi memphis car virtually identical model motor trend import car year award door sedan purchase equip later valve donc engine produce

283,auto, the new 2000 nissan maxima  i really don t know why the designers at nissan motors would change the body style of such a good looking automobile  i think the new design is very ugly it looks to dam futuristic  its not as bad as the oval shaped ford tauras  but compared to the 99 maxima the 2000 is gross  i do however think that the added horsepower and standard features makes the new maxima an even better automobile despite the new look  the maxima has always been a high performance car thats fun to drive  with lots of room and a low price tag  so if you can stomach the new body style  it s still a great car br br  ,new nissan maxim really know designer nissan motor would change body style good look automobile think new design ugly look dam futuristic bad oval shape ford taras compare maxim gross however think add horsepower standard feature make new maxim even better automobile despite new look maxim always high performance car fun drive lot room low price tag stomach new body style still great car br
284,camera, if you re in the market for a digital camera  there has never been a better time to buy  the high tech electronics marketplace is absolutely glutted with digital cameras  nifty features and consumer options are way up  and prices are way down  currently available digital camera models cover the resolution range from less than one megapixel to almost six megapixels  prices range from less than fifty dollars to more than five thousand dollars  the dotcom meltdown and the downturn in the economy coincided perfectly with the digital camera marketing and manufacturing tool up peak  the crucial holiday period saw new digital camera models being discounted as they were introduced  something unheard of until this past christmas  several popular models from major manufacturers dropped hundreds of dollars overnight  the sony corporation has always been a leader in the digital camera marketplace and that leadership position has allowed sony to exact a high tariff from buyers  sony digital cameras have always been among the most expensive models available  sony s managers may have seen the economic writing on the wall a little earlier than their competitors  the introduction of cd r and cd rw storage media in their popular mavica line obviously signals sony s first steps in a move away from the company s proprietary memory stick format  sony s executives haven t forgotten the painful marketing lessons they learned in the beta vs vhs video format wars of the eighties  sony s new dsc s85 was the first the first consumer four megapixel digital camera to hit dealers shelves  last summer  and the real news in that introduction was the list price of  799  this was well below the expected  1000 to  1200 price tag  the new sony model is almost identical to the popular sony dsc s75  utilizing the dsc s75 as a platform for the s85 allowed sony s engineers to save a lot of research and development money  these r d savings were passed on to consumers in the form of a lower msrp   the camera  the dsc s85 features the proven carl zeiss vario sonnar 3x zoom lens  an accurate auto focus system  an optical view finder  and a 1 8 inch lcd display  all in a compact package that looks and performs like an upscale 35mm point and shoot  the 4 1 megapixel ccd provides superb images  2272x1704 pixels  that actually get pretty close to the resolution of a scanned 35mm negative  3000x2000 pixels  giving digital photographers image quality options that were beyond the financial reach of most consumers until very recently  in real terms this means 11x14 enlargements of digital images that are comparable to 11x14 enlargements from 35mm film  while resolution parity between digital cameras and silver based imaging is still a couple of years in the future  somewhere between six and eight megapixels  you can shoot digital images today that roughly approach 35mm quality levels  and for considerably less than  1000  which is what a 1 3 megapixel digital camera cost just three years ago b features   optical viewfinder  the optical viewfinder covers about 85  of the actual image area and zooms with the lens  there s no viewfinder information display  just a set of af crosshair marks  there is a diopter adjustment for those who wear glasses   controls  the controls are well laid out with most commonly used features linked to buttons  rather menu driven  the mode switch quickly rotates between setup  review  auto  aperture priority  shutter priority  manual   scn  and movie  buttons on the back provide controls for flash  macro mode  exposure compensation  spot metering  manual focus mode  and ae lock   3x zoom lens  the s85 features a sharp fast f2 0 f8 0 34 102mm  35mm equivalent  carl zeiss vario sonnar zoom  the lens is a proven performer that was already in the sony inventory  allowing additional savings when they tooled up for the s85  the 3x optical zoom s focus range is from 19 7 inches to infinity in normal mode  1 6 to 8 inches in the macro mode  the camera powers on with the lens at the mid point  so it is relatively quick and easy to zoom to either end of the range  add on wide angle and telephoto extenders may be attached with the optional vad s70 lens adapter  which also allows the use of inexpensive 52mm filters   flash  the built in flash features settings for automatic  redeye reduction  fill flash  and off  the optional hvl f1000 sony external flash extends the range and provides bounce options   battery  the s85 s power comes from a sony  m  series np fm50 infolithium rechargeable 7 2v battery  and it tells you  on the lcd  how many minutes of runtime you have left  the np fm50 is a sony camcorder battery  kudos to sony for creative engineering  adapting a high powered battery from another product line  an absolutely brilliant move that allowed them to increase savings by using a proven component already in inventory  and an opportunity to overcome a constant complaint  short battery life  from consumers  the battery charges quickly and will run for more than three hours  with flash and almost continuous lcd use  on a single charge  both battery and charger adaptor

handling and operation  i have a good friend who sells and distributes photographic equipment  he provides me with  tips  about digital cameras that are real bargains  models that are selling  and performing  very well  and occasionally about clunkers and models to avoid  this advice is a great help to me because i work very hard to make my camera reviews as good as they can be  having a friend in the industry gives me access to information that is not usually available to the general public  photography magazines have a vested interest  advertising from camera photo equipment manufacturers makes up the greatest part of their income  in putting a positive spin on every model and accessory that they test  my friend lets me in on what is usually known only to industry insiders  his latest tip was about what a tremendous bargain sony s new cybershot dsc s85 digital camera is  it turns out that he had one returned by a local photographer who has been shooting 35mm for more than thirty years  this guy bought the sony cybershot dsc s85 after reading a very positive photo mag review  he was really disappointed when the images weren t as good as those he was used to getting with slow speed 35mm slide film  he also complained about all the images having a  pinkish cast  since the gentleman has always been a good customer my friend allowed him to return the camera  my friend has been carrying the s85 around for about a week and he asked me if i would like join him on a photographic outing to test the camera s white balance  which could have been the cause of the  pinkish cast  and its overall performance before he sent it back to sony  i am always ready to drop everything and go play with a new camera  even when it is cold as hell outside  louisville has finally gotten a little winter weather the past couple of weeks so i have been avoiding any unnecessary trips outside  however  the opportunity to check out a new four megapixel digital camera made me forget how cold it was we got together early saturday afternoon and spent about two hours shooting  street  images along bardstown road in the highlands  we then made a quick trip into cherokee park to shoot some winter shots along beargrass creek  the s85 did an admirable job with the static shots of the ice bound creek  but wasn t completely up to the job of hitting the  decisive moment  in our  street  photography efforts  digital cameras don t usually perform very well in  action  photography settings  sports   street  shooting  and wildlife photography remain beyond the capabilities of most digital cameras because of shutter lag and start up cycle write record times  the s85 s shutter lag is pretty short for a four megapixel camera  but the start up cycle time lag is a bit longer than average  we took along a nikon f4s with a 35 1 4 ais nikkor and a 105 2 8d af micro nikkor to shoot comparison images  the f4s was loaded with iso 100 kodak elitechrome slide film  after we finished at beargrass creek  we returned to my friend s and set up a small area with a white backdrop and a light box to shoot some close ups and check the white balance capabilities of the s85  the one button white balance feature works well and we were not able to duplicate the  pinkish cast  that my friends customer had complained about  we shot a large fruit basket my friend had gotten as a christmas gift from one of his suppliers  the woven raffia basket contained two navel oranges  two huge bright red apples  some pecans  in the shell  and three bright mint green pears  the fruit basket made an absolutely perfect photo subject and the images were almost faultless  the s85 s metering did an exceptional job of getting the exposures right in both auto and aperture priority mode  the colors were a bit over saturated  but very accurate  louisville received between two and three inches of fresh snow over night  and when we got together just before noon on sunday we headed straight for cherokee park to shoot some winter wonderland stuff in the woods while the white stuff was till new and pristine  we went to  dog hill   louisville s premier sledding venue  to shoot sledders  the new snow was soft and wet  making for some blazingly fast sled runs down the long steep hill  the s85 wasn t able to lock on and capture decent shots of the fast moving sleds  many of the sledders were dressed in very bright colors and we were able to shoot them easily with the f4s  loaded with kodak iso 100 color print film  and both the 35 1 4 and the 105 2 8  once the cold started to be a little bit painful  we returned to my friend s place and he ran the slides and color prints while i organized my notes and started putting this review together  we compared the slides  on a color corrected light table with a schneider 6x loupe  and 4x6 color prints to the digital images from the s85  the slide images were significantly sharper  with much better contrast  and truer color  but the s85 s images compared quite favorably with the kodak iso 100 color prints  the s85 had an irritating tendency to over expose the snow scenes  which could have been easily controlled with a neutral density filter  but since the lighting was pretty dull it wasn t too much of a problem  in brightly lit snow or beach scenes i think the s85 would be very likely to blow out everything in the scene without a neutral density filter in place b a few concerns  the proprietary sony  memory stick  digital storage media  rather than the more versatile industry standard compactflash  and the single model proprietary sony external flash are my primary complaints against the new s85  slow start up cycle times  a bit longer than comparable models from other manufacturers  are balanced by the shot to shot times which are a little better than average  no filter threads on the lens  you have to buy a proprietary sony adaptor  the s85 suffers from low light color inaccuracies and there is a bit of barrel distortion with the zeiss vario sonnar zoom lens  noise control is very good in well lit outdoor scenes  but noticeable in indoor  flash  and low light shots  there isn t any way to confirm correct focus in the manual focus mode   conclusion  as the gentleman who returned the s85 we tested learned  digital photography is not the same as 35mm film photography  however if you are technically competent and motivated  this camera can be a very impressive imaging tool  overall  the s85 is a very good performer  capable of producing excellent pictures  the camera is relatively easy to use with good ergonomics and well placed logical controls  the s85 handles most lighting conditions very well  has an excellent carl zeiss zoom  an autofocus system that is quick and accurate  very good macro performance  with close focus of about an inch and a half  and a wide range of manual options  the sony cybershot dsc s85 is a real bargain too  the best priced 4 megapixel digital camera currently available  sony s engineers have done an exceptional job of developing a feature rich four megapixel digital camera while holding down costs  the s85 can be found  with a little research  for between  600 and  700  which is  100 300 less than comparable 4 megapixel digital cameras from other manufacturers  for more information on  how to choose a digital camera  please see my review a href elec

285,camera, i don t own an fd 71  but i use one extensively at work  i ve never read the manual  don t know where it is  but i ve been able to use every feature on the camera  it s that intuitive  overall  the camera is very easy to use  the battery seems to last for quite a long time even with the lcd screen running  and the resolution is okay  not the greatest  but okay for archival purposes like other sony mavica digital cameras  the fd 71 uses a standard 1 4m floppy disk for  film  you really can t beat the ease of use and compatibility that this provides  most of the features are menu driven and controlled by a nice little directional pad on the back of the camera  the fd 71 does not have an optical viewfinder  which can seem strange at first  pictures are always composed using the backlit lcd screen for some reason  pictures always seem crisper on the lcd screen than they actually do once they are written to disk  the resolution of the fd 71 is not professional quality on the normal setting  where you can put about 20  pictures onto a disk  there is a high quality setting  but this limits you to a single picture per disk  the focusing and zoom range of the fd 71 is astounding  it can photograph objects in sharp focus about as close as one or two centimeters  i have also found that indoor photos almost always require a flash in order to get a good picture overall the fd 71 is probably a good choice for a company that needs to take pictures or products or other items that will be published on the web  for web publication  the resolution of the fd 71 is more than adequate  the fd 71 would also be a good choice for a home user that wants to take lots of photos and exchange them with friends via email or disk br br  ,ff use one extensively work never read manual know able use every feature camera intuition overall camera easy use battery seem last quite long time even lead screen run resolution okay greatest okay arrival purpose like sonya mavra digital camera ff use standard floppy disk film really beat ease use incompatibility provide feature menu drive control nice little direction pad back camera ff optical viewfinder seem strange first picture always compose use backlit lead screen reason picture always seem whisper lead screen actually write disk resolution ff professional quality normal set put picture onto disk high quality set limit single picture per disk rouse room range ff astound photograph object sharp focus close one two centimetres also find indoor photo almost always require flash order get good picture overall ff probably good choice company need take picture products items publish web web publication resolution ff adequate ff would also good choice home user want take lot photo exchange friends via email disk br
286,auto, this summer  my dad drove my new  to me anyway  1997 cherry red mustang gt into the driveway  to say the least  i was in heaven  at age 17  this is my dream car  although i have only had it a few months and have experienced a few problems  i wouldn t want any other car first of all  i love the body style  it doesn t look plastic like the newer squarer models  it also has plenty of power with a v 8  actually  a little too much power if you live in the mountains like i do with curves everywhere  in fact  this is what caused me to wreck my car  yes  i was driving a little too fast on that curvy road  but not too fast for a sports car  before i got my car  i used to drive my boyfriends camaro  and it handles curves like a dream  so naturally  i tried to same thing in my car and ended up fishtailing it into a ditch  lesson learned  i now take curves slowly  another problem is shifting into reverse  sometimes  it just won t shift at all  and other times it will grind in that gear  so  when this problem arises  i have to shift it up into first  rev it  then it usually goes into reverse a month or two ago  i tried to leave the senior parking lot but after cranking the engine  it would die  unless i kept it revving  we had to drive my car home constantly revving the engine and pressing the gas  which was dangerous on the wet roads that day  until we could get it to the shop  the last problem i have with my gt is that it squeaks a lot  sometimes it does this on left turns  other times it does it in the back  sounds like it is coming from the trunk  i usually just crank up the music cuz i have no idea where this is coming from  but the bottom line is  although the car has problems  it also has 55 000 miles on it and still looks brand new  besides the dent from my wreck  i love this car  and the feeling i get behind the wheel is definately worth having to drag it to the shop every once in a while  ,summer dad drive new anyway cherry red driveway say least heaven age dream car although months experience problems want car first love body style look plastic like newer square model also plenty power actually little much power live mountains like curve everywhere fact cause wreck car yes drive little fast curly road fast sport car get car use drive boyfriend camera candle curve like dream naturally try thing car end fishtail ditch lesson learn take curve slowly another problem shift reverse sometimes shift time grind gear problem arise shift first rev usually go reverse month two ago try leave senior park lot crack engine would die unless keep revive drive car home constantly revive engine press gas dangerous wet roads day could get shop last problem squeaky lot sometimes leave turn time back sound like come trunk usually crank music cut idea come bottom line although car problems also miles still look brand new besides go wreck love car feel get behind wheel definitely worth drag shop every
287,camera,  overview  the folks at olympus have often been innovators in both the 35mm camera and digital imaging worlds  their half frame pen f cameras from the early sixties offered photographers the option of 72 images on a standard  36 exp  roll of 35mm film  with all the lenses and accessories of a true  system  camera  the olympus om1 of 1977 was the first of the compact full feature 35mm cameras  a system that revolutionized camera design  the olympus om3ti and om4ti 35mm cameras are still available for fans of precision built manual focus 35mm cameras  the olympus d300l was the first  serious  prosumer digital camera  at a time when most consumer digital cameras were toys  the d300l was a capable and competent image maker  olympus followed the d300l with the c2500l digital slr  aimed right at the heart of the growing digital imaging movement  a quality digital camera that eschewed  bells   whistles in favor of solid engineering and first class image making capabilities at a price that withered the competition  the new olympus camedia e10 digital slr continues this tradition of innovation and unique solutions to imaging challenges there are only a handful of serious  pro  level digital cameras on the market  the nikon d1  canon s new d30  the fuji finepix s1 pro  and a couple of 35mm pro models  modified to do digital duty  from kodak  olympus has engineered a new camera  that it claims can compete with these top of the line  pro  digital slr s  the new olympus camedia e10 digital slr  costing less than two grand  offers convincing evidence that pro features are available without the  3500 to  6000 initial investment required with all the other  pro  model digital slr s  the olympus e10 accomplishes these design breakthroughs by using new approaches to solve old problems  how does the e10 do this  most importantly  the camera doesn t offer interchangeable lenses  instead olympus has designed a new 9 36mm  35 140mm 35mm equivalent  f2 0 2 4 zoom lens that was engineered from its inception to mate perfectly with the olympus four megapixel  2 3 inch  ccd sensor  this  designed from scratch  zoom lens and ccd sensor  combo  provide an extremely clean  sharp as a tack  and noise free 2240x1680 image file  ccd sensors are far less forgiving of stray and indirect light than silver based film  olympus engineers took this fact into consideration and designed the one piece rigid body camera lens unit to capitalize on the differences between traditional silver based imaging materials and digital imaging technology  digital sensors require a direct  straight line  path  stray light and reflections seriously degrade the quality of the final image  the e10 s new  super corrected  zoom is focused directly on the ccd  and offers exceptional resolution throughout the zoom range b cutting edge design   engineering  olympus s new digital slr doesn t compromise on image quality  features  performance  or  pro  capabilities  olympus claims that the one piece body and lens design offers better alignment between lens and ccd  improving image resolution and eliminating dust and contaminants inside the camera  dust and particulate contaminants inside the mirror box are a real concern with the nikon d1 and the fuji finepix s1 pro  both require fairly regular  dust control  and a can of compressed air is a needed extra component  in addition olympus has incorporated a very powerful 32 mb sdram to rapidly process the 4 megapixel images at rates of up to 3 fps  for up to four frames  which works in conjunction with the proprietary olympus  true pic  system to optimize all captured data in  real time  before saving the data to storage media olympus designed the new 4 megapixel  3 9 effective  ccd to enhance brightness perception  this is accomplished by using two green filters for every red and blue filter  green significantly increases the perception of brightness  and this makes colors appear richer  brighter  and fuller  three metering options  esp multi pattern  centerweighted  and spot  exposure compensation  3ev  and auto bracketing help to insure consistently correct exposures the controls on the e10 are logically laid out  olympus asked professional photographers to offer advice on the optimal operational layout of the camera  and then they followed that advice  the result is a camera that photographers will love  because it was in large part designed for photographers  by photographers  ergonomically the e10  fits the hands well  is extremely easy to operate  the controls are intuitive  and all buttons and switches are within easy reach when holding the camera  olympus says the camera can be operated in the dark  by touch b features  two separate af modes work in tandem to insure focusing precision and accuracy  manual focus and manual zoom capabilities are especially attractive  since they will feel  right  to photographers who learned image making with manual cameras  shooting in aperture or shutter priority  or full manual mode will allow the control  that photographers who insist on being completely in charge of their image making  insist on  white balance can be individually tailored for a wide variety of shooting conditions with seven color temperature settings  virtually any lighting situation can be mastered by using the  one touch  white balance adjustment  auto  ttl  white balance produced some of the truest skin tones i have ever seen the e10 offers slots for both  smart media  and compact flash  types i   ii  cards  depending on the capacity of the card employed  a huge number of images can be stored  this provides an obvious advantage  since the photographer can shoot quite a few images before the storage media needs to be replaced  the e10 utilizes a usb  storage class  interface for fast and easy data transfer  your computer will  recognize  the camera as an external drive b in the field operation   handling  the olympus e10 functions intuitively  as soon as you pick up the camera  your fingers instantly find the controls  the optional  power grip  is a highly recommended accessory  this provides a vertical shutter release  plus the four additional batteries will extend operation time significantly  i had about sixty minutes to check out the camera  as far as i know it was the first e10 in louisville  and there were a couple of other photographers who were waiting impatiently for their turn to play with it  i was very impressed with its ease of operation  after everyone had spent a little time with the camera we were shown two 8x10 custom prints from e10 tiff files that were the best digital images i have ever seen  they were comparable to 35mm slide prints b technical specifications  4

to see this camera as the next logical step in their digital photography evolution  pro features  four megapixel images  solid construction  and cutting edge design for two thousand bucks is going to

288,camera, after days of online research and lots of touchy feely i was totally won over by the canon a20  i own a canon camcorder and was very impressed by the quality and ease of use  this helped me make my decision for the a20  from the time i picked it up in circuit city i knew i was holding a quality camera  the weight and solid body feels great in your hands  almost like a professional 35mm  i wasnt crazy about those micro mini digicameras  canon uses good quality plastics  the buttons have a nice positive feel to them  the screen is a decent size  i use the camera mainly for posting pics on the web and snaping shots of my kids  occasionally i ll print them on my hp photo printer  the 4x6 quality is outstanding  youll want to get a larger compact flash card  this form of media is realy cheap now  it took me no time at all to master the menu system  just give yourself about an hour or two with the manual and you ll be ok  give a look at the specs at the canon web site  one thing that i was mislead about was the use of alkaline batts with this unit  forget it  the manual says you can but you ll get only a few shots off before it shuts down  go with the 1600mah nimh rechargebles  you will be very happy with the battery life using the nimh batts  for me  this was everything i needed in a digicamera without being overweighted with a lot of extras i wasnt going to use  avoid buying a camera sight unseen  go out and play with them at the store  take it home  use it  feel comfortable with it  most major electronic retailers have good return policies  buy with confidence  ,days online research lot touch feel totally canon canon camcorder impress quality ease use help make decision time pick circuit city know hold quality camera weight solid body feel great hand almost like professional mm want crazy micro mind digicameras canon use good quality plastic button nice positive feel screen decent size use camera mainly post pick web shape shots kiss occasionally print photo printer quality outstanding want get larger compact flash card form media really cheap take time master menu system give hour two manual ok give look speck canon web site one thing mislead use alkaline bath unit forget manual say get shots shut go may nigh rechargebles happy battery life use nigh bath everything need digicamera without overweighted lot extra want go use avoid buy camera sight unseen go play store take home use feel comfortable major electronic retainers good return policies buy confidence
289,camera, hubby and i were in a best buy in april 2003  he was looking at computer peripherals while i wandered around browsing the displays  then i thought to look at the digital cameras  i d been intrigued by the mavica floppydisk concept  imagine my delight when i found they had a cd r model available  i called hubby over and we did end up buying it  the cd400 has many features which may require a little bit of instruction manual study  luckily the manual is clear and concise  i recommend experimenting with the settings to see the results  a disc is cheap i took the camera on vacation to southern california the first week of june  i took over 600 photos all on one disc  boy  this beats film cameras and those  memory sticks  for other digital cameras  the bulkiness may be an issue for some people  the mavica cameras are about the size of an slr camera  my own opinion is that the advantages of the mavica make its bulkiness a non issue be careful with the viewscreen  it is an lcd screen and is easily damaged  i wish sony made a clip on cover for it but they don t  if you have the camera strap around your neck  and there are buttons on your shirt  they may scratch or abrade the lcd screen  the number of images which you can fit on a disc will vary according to what image size you choose  and what resolution you choose  shutter lag varies according to the type of photo you are taking  manual settings for long exposures need a second  the camera will take a few seconds to process data from long exposures  this is normal  the mavica mvc cd 400 uses a camcorder battery  which you charge while it is in the camera  i highly recommend one or two spare batteries  the camera will use a lot of  juice  especially for flash photos and movie clips movie clips  yes indeed  the mavica has a built in microphone and will record a short movie clip in mp3 format  you can view the images in several ways  first  you can use the review function on the camera and see them on the viewscreen  second  you can attach the supplied a v cable to the camera and a tv  third  you can remove the completed disc from the camera and download the images to your computer this camera can do a whole lot  below is a partial list of features image size  2272x1704 very fine prints 2272 3 2  printing in 3 2 ratio 1600x1200 printing in a4 format 1280x960 printing in postcard size 640x480 attaching to e mail image quality can be set to fine or standard red eye reduction macro portrait landscape date and time stamp manual exposures 1 1000 second to 8 seconds manual apertures f2 to f8 focus location in the frame can be selected white balance special effects   b   w  sepia  negative  posterize 3 image burst image zoom ,hobby best buy april look computer peripheral wander around browse display think look digital camera intrigue mavra floppydisk concept imagine delight find model available call hobby end buy many feature may require little bite instruction manual study luckily manual clear concise recommend experiment settings see result disc cheap take camera vacation southern california first week june take photo one disc boy beat film camera memory stick digital camera business may issue people mavra camera size sir camera opinion advantage mavra make business non issue careful viewscreen lead screen easily damage wish sonya make clip cover camera strap around neck button shirt may scratch abrade lead screen number image fit disc vary accord image size choose resolution choose shutter law vary accord type photo take manual settings long exposures need second camera take second process data long exposures normal mavra mac use camcorder battery charge camera highly recommend one two spare batteries camera use lot juice especially flash photo movie clip movie clip yes indeed mavra build microphone record short movie clip format view image several ways first use review function camera see viewscreen second attach supply cable camera third remove complete disc camera download image computer camera whole lot partial list feature image size fine print print ratio print format print postcard size attach mail image quality set fine standard red eye reduction micro portrait landscape date time stamp manual exposures second second manual aperture focus location frame select white balance special effect septa negative posterior image burst image room

291,camera, my vivitar 2700 is now broken   the battery door is gone  and the display is cracked   but i can honestly say i don t miss it much  i bought it at an online auction for about  100  so it didn t set me back much  but i was also very disappointed with it  it is a very simple camera  that takes low quality shots  occasionally it did actually give me really good looking shots  but there was no system to when it produced good shots and bad shots  not one that i could figure out anyway   it is a very basic camera  and if you get it  don t expect anything to turn out like what you would expect from a non digital slr or point and shoot  the pictures i got most of the time were grainy  lacking in colour and contrast  and generally looked just boring  it is a fairly small camera  but there are smaller and better cameras around today the 2700 eats batteries  especially if you use the lcd display a lot  keep a lot of extra batteries around  transferring pictures from camera to pc is fairly easy  although it is obvious that vivitar didn t exactly kill themselves when they designed the software  so  take it for what it is   a cheap digital camera  with quality to match br br  ,visitor break battery door go display crack honestly say miss much buy online auction set back much also disappoint simple camera take low quality shots occasionally actually give really good look shots system produce good shots bad shots one could figure anyway basic camera get expect anything turn like would expect non digital sir point shoot picture get time grain lack colour contrast generally look bore fairly small camera smaller better camera around today eat batteries especially use lead display lot keep lot extra batteries around transfer picture camera pp fairly easy although obvious visitor exactly kill design software take cheap digital camera quality match br
292,auto, at least not that i ve seen  and this was the car that i signed papers on  yes  papers were signed before i changed my mind and you can do that  you know  you are not responsible until that car is driven off the lot  like  all the way out the driveway  even if you are halfway out of the driveway   which is about how it was with me that deal is not done  so  remember after you sign and you are walking to put key in ignition  that long walk  you can still change your mind poor mazda  this is one of the most handsome cars in the compact class with sharper outside styling than anyone else  it s also one of the roomiest in both front and back  it s also one of the least advertised  a year ago  i had no idea that there was any such car called a mazda protege  until i read consumer reports and how they felt that it was their best compact car  even if least popular among new car sales and this is exactly the dilemma  why is a car that consumer reports calls  1 not at the top of the new cars being actually bought the reason is that mazda refuses to do the same sort of promotion and advertising that toyota and honda relentlessly do  the mazda protege is essentially a japanese import that is put together with the same quality  i found  that toyota and honda do  but  mazda s parent company lincoln mercury  which are subsidiaries of ford  actually has decided to promote other cars this shows in the brochure for the mazda protege  which i thought misrepresented the protege as frivolous  unsubstantial  teenybopper  and non serious  things that i didn t find were true about the protege  and yet my lincoln mercury dealer didn t even have a protege on the lot and was very surprised that anyone would come in inquiring about one so  in the end  i was concerned about driving something that wasn t that popular and that i didn t see much of around  i don t know how consumer reports is coming up with reliability statistics if not enough people have bought this car to have real life experiences with it there were little things that bothered me that probably wouldn t bother anyone else  i am absolutely obsessed with interiors and the fact that the protege s door handles were of a silver  that silver gets hot in the sun  instead of matching the layout and fabric of the rest of the fit and finish  bothered me  the fact that the dashboard was of a different color or shade than the radio and controls  plus the steering wheel was not of a uniform texture  picky  picky  picky  still  i think that when everything of the interior fit and finish matches  is the same color and texture  it spells quality and adds to the plushness  and interior comfort  coziness and quality is my thing  as opposed to outside styling the car also seemed loud upon acceleration  then again  anything seems loud to me the handling was absolutely great  this could be a honda if you didn t know otherwise i don t know anything about the protege s safety record other than i certainly  quot felt quot  absolutely safe  and that s how i judge safety  do i actually  quot feel quot  safe in the car  not necessarily what do the safety statistics show  sometimes all that one can interpret from safety statistics is that there are a lot of bad drivers out there  these statistics aren t always representative of the car s actual safety  just all the  quot unsafe quot  drivers i think it was the roominess which made me feel like it was a much larger car  that made me feel safe  did i mention the seat height adjustment which is unusual on a compact car mazda protege does have a cult following  and there are many on epinions who write favorable things about protege  i would encourage those fans to try to write to mazda to do more advertising and promotion so that more people would know about this car and the actual sales of protege would go up br br  ,least see car sign paper yes paper sign change mind know responsible car drive lot like way driveway even halfway driveway deal

295,camera, highly recommended for those who want to record the important moments  people who think they can use a digital camera and still be a professional photographer should get the nikon coolpix 990  if you are a professional photographer  you should be looking at the high end kodak cameras i ve used the nikon coolpix 950 and 990 for work through most of 2000  but the camera i purchased for myself was the dsc p1  for me  it offered just about everything that i used in the 990 albeit in a much smaller form factor  working with the larger cameras  i realized that portability was very important to me the camera s pretty small  and always manages to turn heads  image quality is very good at 3 3 megapixels  easily comparable to the 990  build quality is very good   sturdy  compact  with very few  quot breakable quot  protrusions  not that you d want to drop anything that costs  800  the 3x optical zoom is pretty decent too  with little barrel distortion  these are the camera s greatest strengths typical of other sony  quot gadget quot  hardware  the dsc p1 has a plethora of gimmicky features  including the ability to record mpeg1 movies  output straight to a tv  both audio and video  via rca cable  and various special effect  program ae  just like their camcorders  filters  most of these are pretty fun to play with  however in practice they are not that useful for when it counts  despite having an inferior video recording capability  it is very cool that such a small solid state device can do it in the first place  its too bad there isn t any mp3 feature   the hardware seems perfect for it with a built in volume control  speaker  and audio out  via the tv out port  i disabled the digital zoom when i first powered on the camera   i don t belive in digital zoom  never have and never will  in my opinion  the fact that it is a sony is both its best and worst aspect  because its sony there s a level of quality that is easy to notice and appreciate  also because its sony it uses proprietary infolithium batteries and memory sticks the infolithium battery is pretty good  actually   comparable in lifetime to many batteries out on the market  you get about 1 hour and 20 minutes of continuous use with the battery  and can recharage whenever and and as many times as you want  just by plugging the supplied power cord in memory stick is another matter  yes  it does look kinda sexy  but is limited by lack of competitors since it is proprietary  64mb is the largest size you can get  and they aren t too cheap  about  150 for the 64mb  this is in comparison to other storage media  such as microdrives or compactflash  115 for 64mb  if it were available  i would ve gone out and gotten the 256mb  the camera comes with an 8mb card  one of the worst rip offs ever for a currently brand new digital camera  you can put about 6 pictures on 8 mb  if you have a vaio computer you can just plug in the memory stick   nice  usb connection works very similar   the software just treats the camera as a removable drive   also very nice the camera is strictly high end amateur  there is no manual focus  and you cannot attach lenses to it  that s perfect for me  i want to record the important moments in my life  so this little wonder that fits in my jacket pocket is great  if you re attaching zoom lenses and stuff to a camera  you re going to need a tripod  and lots of light anyways  so the portability aspect of a camera loses its importance  i ve found in practice that i never used those extra aspects anyways with the nikon cameras     ,highly recommend want record important moments people think use digital camera still professional photographer get union coolpix professional photographer look high end today camera use union coolpix

296,auto, i have had my cherokee sport since new in 1995  no problems with it at all  and have only had to replace the exhaust system  still haven t had my first tune up and it runs very well  i find the command track transmission to be excellent as you can change back and forth from 2 to 4 wheel drive while driving  gas mileage while in 4wd is horrible  you can almost watch the gas needle move  although it is quite comfortable to drive  unlike some other sport utility vehicles the jeep is still very much like a truck  pickup  than anything close to driving a luxury car  the 4 door model is nice  although the back doors are small  and it is difficult for an adult to climb in comfortably  the 4 0litre engine offers good pickup when you need to accelerate  the standard stereo system is more than adequate and sounds fine  the a c system has been much more dependable than other vehicles i ve purchased and i ve only had to recharge it once in 8 years  ,cherokee sport since new problems replace exhaust system still first tune run well find command track transmission excellent change back forth wheel drive drive gas mileage horrible almost watch gas needle move although quite comfortable drive unlike sport utility vehicles deep still much like truck pick anything close drive luxury car door model nice although back doors small difficult adult climb comfortably litre engine offer good pick need accelerate standard sterno system adequate sound fine system much dependable vehicles purchase charge years
297,camera, anyone considering a digital camera should read the excellent reviews in epinions first  this  review  is just a footnote to those  i bought this for my daughter after buying last year s model last year for my other daughter  the a40  both have been good  dependable cameras  both of my teen age daughters use their camera to make photos on line and the occasional print  what many teens seem to do  we like this camera because it is big enough to hold comfortably  it feels like a camera  we got our fingers in the picture with our small camera  for us  a larger size is important  when buying a camera don t forget to budget about  100 for essential accessories  an extra compact flash card  nimh batteries  a case  and a card reader for your computer  think carefully about how much you will use the camera  for light use  alkaline batteries are a good choice  nimh batteries cost at least  50 while alkalines cost about  5 00 per set and seem to last long enough  budget for the nimh but hold off until you find you need them  the camera works well reading directly into canon s new printers  there are limitations to this  you can t edit much  but you can get a print quickly at home  it has been handy a few times but if you have friends over  for example  it s a great idea  the canon printers are excellent  the quality of 4x6 prints is superb for an amateur camera  no camera in this range has a hot shoe for a heavy duty flash  something i wish this type of camera had  you need a small case when carrying the camera around  ,anyone consider digital camera read excellent review opinions first review footnote buy daughter buy last year model last year daughter good dependable camera age daughters use camera make photo line occasional print many tens seem like camera big enough hold comfortably feel like camera get finger picture small camera us larger size important buy camera forget budget essential accessories extra compact flash card nigh batteries case card reader computer think carefully much use camera light use alkaline batteries good choice nigh batteries cost least alkaline cost per set seem last long enough budget nigh hold find need camera work well read directly canon new printers limitations edit much get print quickly home handy time friends example great idea canon printers excellent quality print superb amateur camera camera range hot shoe heavy duty flash something wish type camera need small case carry camera around

300,camera, okay you have read all the reviews here about this digital camera  but you haven t heard my opinion yet of it first thing  what s in the box  software that needs to be upgraded to version 2 51  which you can get that from olympus web site so that s an easy download for those of us who using windows xp home or pro version the 8 meg smart media card is okay  but i quickly got the 128 meg card for it  highly recommended you get that if you plan on taking a lot of pictures and using the quicktime movie feature as for the batteries you need to buy rechargeable ones like rayovac nimh 1600 mah aa  well you can use any other brand  but that s what i use and so far after 37 photo s with flash and hq setting they still showing full charge you might want to buy a mini tripod so you can have the camera take shots of you and someone else using the timer built in  well it s a suggestion there isn t a case for this camera  so you can buy one for it  yes it has its own built in lens cover which slides forward and back and turns on the camera and off  but my advice gets a case for it  protect your purchase in all you can sum this camera up  powerful  excellent pictures and cost is very low for taking very professional looking pictures and viewing them on your home tv or pc the newer version the d 520  doesn t have all the features like this camera like the iso only goes up to 80 160 while the d 510z has a range from 100   400 if you can find this camera  but it  you won t be sorry if you do good luck  ,okay read review digital camera hear opinion yet first thing box software need upgrade version get polypus web site easy download us use windows home pro version meg smart media card okay quickly get meg card highly recommend get plan take lot picture use quicktime movie feature batteries need buy rechargeable ones like rayovac nigh may well use brand use far photo flash set still show full charge might want buy mind try camera take shots someone else use time build well suggestion case camera buy one yes build lens cover side forward back turn camera advice get case protect purchase sum camera powerful excellent picture cost low take professional look picture view home pp newer version feature like camera like iso go range find camera sorry good luck
301,camera, our first digital camera was a little polaroid that got about 1 4 megapixel for resolution  320 x 280 around there  without a flash  then we stepped up to a vivicam 3500  it was only 1 2 megapixels  it had a flash and took pretty decent pictures  but had a terrible lag between each  now we ve moved up to the vivicam 3715  having paid less for it than we did the 3500  and we re overall pretty happy with that one  too reason i bought it was our vivicam 3500 will no longer power on  it works when it s on  but getting it to turn on is the miracle  something happened to the power button i believe as if you ever do get it to turn on  it will not turn off again  i m not sure how much that will cost and being as it really wasn t my camera i wanted one of my own as it was  so with a little research i decided to buy the budget friendly vivicam 3715 the vivicam 3715 offers a flash as well as 4x digital zoom  which i don t use you want optical zoom  and 3 3 megapixel resolution  the lag between photos is not nearly as bad  and when the flash is on the picture snaps almost instantly  it is versitile enough to take pictures in bright daylight or in the low light of night  with a tripod  for  132 88 i certainly couldn t ask a digital camera to do more  comparitively  the fuji camera with similar resolution was about twice as much photo quality is very good  i was happy enough with the vivicam 3500 to not use a film camera unless i needed a faster shutterspeed  that camera was poor for moving pictures  this camera can take moving pictures better but shutter speed is still a lot slower than the potential speeds of a professional digital camera or a film camera  i typically don t feel i need a film camera when i have this little guy around as i m generally happy enough with the pictures to print them up off my computer as they come from this camera  i believe that it captures detail very well  even on medium size and quality  which i feel is plenty for most purposes  but still leaves a little to be desired when looking for fine detail or the ability to zoom or do macros  it does do macros  but i ll get to that size is a great improvement over the 3500  it s much smaller in dimensions  i d say half the size  and much lighter  i don t know the exact weights but i d say the old camera with batteries weighed around 1 lb whereas this one i d put at 6 8 oz  these are estimates  so it s much friendlier to your neck while it s hanging there  it offers a great display screen that has vibrant and clear colors  it could be larger  but probably not with keeping the camera the same size and weight  but for most picture taking purposes i found it to be adequate  the controls are easy once you get a hang of them  on the back to the right it has a dial that is used to select camera mode  picture viewing editing mode  movie mode  and setup mode  switching between them is very easy  just click to the little icons  which are easy to understand what they are  to the upper right corner of the screen there is a control pad that has an ok button in the middle and directional arrows for up  down  left  and right around it  this is all the same button  but selection is made by pushing it on the desired side  this does get a little bit painstaking as i ve many times hit down or up while trying to push it straight in for ok  the function of these buttons are different depending on what mode you re currently in  in camera mode they serve as flash options  zoom in and out  and timer  in menu mode they are the move  change  and select buttons  in view mode they are the next  previous  delete  and single multi view buttons  all of that is easy enough to understand  however you will probably hit up or down a few times while trying to use ok  i did that in setup once  and being as the first option is language and the default is english i tried to hit okay  instead i hit down and ok and ended up with everything in chinese  i can t read chinese so i was lost  i did fix it eventually but that was certainly good for a few laughs   moral is be careful of that ok button there is also a menu button that allows you to select different options for picture quality  size  and iso  white balance  etc  in picture taking mode  in view mode this gives the option for protect  delete all  slide show  and screen brightness  this can also be adjusted by pushing the little screen button below the control pad to get the lcd options  last two buttons are the power and picture taking buttons  pretty self explanatory  easy to find  and easy to use  sometimes i have to push power again as you have to push it and hold it a second to get it to turn on the camera offers three picture taking modes  macro  normal  people  and scenery  i believe this adjusts the focus  however i have seen little difference between them while taking some experimental pictures  i certainly wouldn t buy the camera on it s macro abilities another option it has is a timer  yes  way cool    a timer  it gives you 10 seconds to run in and sit down  smile pretty  and have the picture snap  it works pretty well  which i ve discovered quite by accident  the timer button is the little  clock  icon or the  right  on the directional control pad the flash is quite adequate for close up pictures  close up meaning less than 12 feet approx  it does tend to produce a lot of red eye but if you push the flash button  the lightning bolt or the left on the control pad  you will eventually see a flash symbol with an eye next to it beneath an a  this means automatic flash with red eye reducer  you ll notice it flashes before the actual picture and flash take place  drives your subject nuts but seems to help a bit  the flash takes awhile to charge  unfortunately  which causes the only real delay between pictures   without it in good light it s very short night pictures can be taken on no flash mode  hit the flash button till a circle and strike through symbol appear over the lightning bolt  however you need a tripod or very steady hand to take them  if you don t get the right kind of lighting or if it s a little yellowish then the whole picture looks yellow  it seems to take about 10 seconds to finish a picture  whatever the shutterspeed is i don t know  but i do know most of mine turned out blurry without a tripod  please also note that means if anything you re picturing moves that will blur  too  the more light it has for the exposure the quicker the picture snaps  but it is painfully slow if you re trying to hold it still the camera comes with 8 mb internal memory but also utilizes sd memory cards  i have a 32 mb card in it right now  the confusing part is if you take pictures on the card and pictures direct on the camera they don t show up in the same place  so when loading pictures from the camera you ll have to load with and without the card if you used both   just use the card if you have it  you can opt to save pictures on the card to the camera  but i like the cards better as they are a more stable form of memory  i believe the camera uses a usb connection which should make it easy to install  however it wasn t  since i have many items on the usb including a 4 hole port it was causing some conflicts with my zip drive  my zip drive is supposed to be removable disk drive d and when the camera was plugged in it was removable disk drive d  so nothing wanted to read the pictures and i kept freezing  what i ended up having to do is have them both plugged in and assign them each permanent drive letters so now the camera is drive e  since then i have no problems  think of the camera when it s hooked up like an extra disk drive  you open it and view the photos like it s a floppy disk  however don t save pictures to the camera use the save image as and put them somewhere else or just copy the lot to a different folder on a disk or the hard drive and edit them from there  if you save to the camera you ll get an invalid format picture when you look at it again  i have some troubles with corel photo house giving me a sharing error  but usually i can get around it by trying one more time  i have psp 7 but it s been malfunctioning lately so i can t use it to view pictures from the camera  it does come with mgi photo suite  but i don t like the program so never use it battery life with energizer e2 batteries is far improved from that of the vivicam 3500 which just ate the batteries  4 aas at a time  this one only uses 2 batteries  aa  and would also eat them if i didn t spend the money for the nicer high drain device batteries  it does pretty good  but could be better considering those batteries are more than 2 00 a piece  i haven t tried rechargables  but that would probably be the better option in the long run  one set of batteries took more than 100 pictures without problem except then i left it connected to the computer and it drained them deader than a doornail   so don t do that the camera has it s little quirks as you ve probably seen from the things i ve described but for the money i m perfectly happy  had i paid more than 200 00 for this camera i d probably take it back as my expectations would have been higher  but for 132 88 i think this little camera does great  one word of advice  however  be sure to buy an ac adapter  3 3v  as it doesn t come with one and it ll save your batteries while loading pictures  ,first digital camera little polaroid get megapixel resolution around without flash step vivicam megapixels flash take pretty decent picture terrible law move

302,camera, looking for an economical compact digital camera  i decided on the kodak 215 millennium  the criteria were simple  it had to be small enough to fit into a jacket pocket or my wife s purse  it should have an optical zoom and at least 1 meg resolution  for the sake of compatibility with my other two  bulkier  digitals  i preferred it to use cf memory and aa batteries as the 215 does like the rest of the package  the 2x zoom is modest  but it works  in classic  point and shoot  style  the camera is handy and user friendly  it is difficult to make too big a mistake  on the other hand  the picture quality is certainly fine enough for web snapshots  but prints are soft and slightly diffuse  the colors mildly unsaturated  it does use up batteries  four aa  surprisingly fast  a charger with a supply of nimh batteries is a must price permitting  the  millennium  version is recommended  if only for the dandy kodak cf card reader that s part of the package  since the camera itself doesn t support usb  this can be very useful  indeed  the camera is well designed and constructed overall  but the battery holder seems fragile  still  no trouble with anything the 215 is probably at the end of its useful marketing life  as technology improves and prices fall it really doesn t hold its own with the competition  for just a small premium  you can now get smaller units with higher resolution and better features  at half the price  it would still be a contender  as it is  we use it regularly for snapshots and as a  loaner  it is so straight forward to use and so easy to carry  i have little doubt we will get our money s worth  ,look economical compact digital camera decide today millennium criterion simple small enough fit jacket pocket wife purse optical room least meg resolution sake incompatibility two bulkier digital prefer use cf memory batteries like rest package room modest work classic point shoot style camera handy user friendly difficult make big mistake hand picture quality certainly fine enough web snapshots print soft slightly diffuse color mildly saturate use batteries four surprisingly fast charge supply nigh batteries must price permit millennium version recommend dandy today cf card reader part package since camera support us useful indeed camera well design construct overall battery holder seem fragile still trouble anything probably end useful market life technology improve price fall really hold competition small premium get smaller units higher resolution better feature half price would still contend use regularly snapshots loafer straight forward use easy carry little doubt get money worth

304,camera, i just received the sony mvc fd73 as a christmas gift from my husband  well  we had only been  quot toying quot  with the idea of a digital camera and one thing i had noticed about the entire sony product line was that they were the only ones offering floppy disk storage  what easier way to take and transfer pictures  pass them along to family and friends  etc it took me only a short time to learn the basics of using this camera  and  given the nature of digital cameras  i had plenty of time and opportunity to  quot practice quot  before i went to my family s for christmas dinner as far as price i checked with several different merchants  both online and offline  and found that you can purchase this model for about  400 with the case  battery  charger  etc there are several cool features available in this model  including a  quot multi quot  function allowing you to take a series of pictures and creating a short video  sort of like the old flip books we had as kids  the picture quality is very good  however  i would recommend using an alternate photo program to the one provided with the camera  the program that comes with the camera is complicated and the pictures do not  quot look quot  as good when you first open them  i use corel photohouse and it is a breeze to make corrections and add even more effects than the camera provides   the camera provides a b amp w  negative  sepia and polarize options there are also some adjustments in lighting and brightness  i haven t yet mastered these  but i play around with them for now  and i haven t memorized the  quot program quot  functions yet  but they auto adjust the settings for a variety of lighting setting combinations and the activity you are trying to photograph also  this camera allows for an instant review of the photos you have taken and you have the option of protecting the photo from deletion or deleting the photo and retaking it while the subjects are still there and  finally a cool idea  if you are interested my daughter just celebrated her 13th birthday and had a house full of girls over for a slumber party  now  i labored over the choices for party favors with my daughter making faces at every suggestion  then on a flash of inspiration i started taking photos of the girls some posed  some candid shots and i made a copy of the disk for each girl to take home with her as a party favor do you know my daughter didn t laugh and the girls were tripping over themselves trying to watch me edit their photos and choosing which ones they wanted on  quot their quot  disks br br  ,receive sonya mac ff christmas gift husband well quit toy quit idea digital camera one thing notice entire sonya product line ones offer floppy disk storage easier way take transfer picture pass along family friends etc take short time learn basis use camera give nature digital camera plenty time opportunity quit practice quit go family christmas dinner far price check several different merchants online office find purchase model case battery charge etc several cool feature available model include quit multi quit function allow take series picture create short video sort like old lip book kiss picture quality good however would recommend use alternate photo program one provide camera program come camera complicate picture quit look quit good first open use morel hothouse breeze make corrections add even effect camera provide camera provide amp negative septa polarize option also adjustments light brightness yet master play around memories quit program quit function yet auto adjust settings variety light set combinations activity try photograph also camera allow instant review photo take option protect photo deletions meet photo take subject still finally cool idea interest daughter celebrate th birthday house full girls slumber party labor choice party favor daughter make face every suggestion flash inspiration start take photo girls pose candid shots make copy disk girl take home party favor know daughter laugh girls trip try watch edit photo choose ones want quit quit disk br
305,auto, there are many different s series saturns  i am writing about the highest end model  the sc 2  the  c  denotes it as being a coupe  and the  2  primarily denotes it as having the larger engine  the expression used to be  2 door coupe  but saturn has now changed that familiar term because their coupes have had three doors since the 1999 model a decade ago  i was working as a claims adjustor for an insurance company when the saturns first came out  i was intrigued with these cars because they had a substantially lower average repair cost than any other car out there  this was not only because of their dent proof  plastic  body  but also because of the fact that car was made to be repaired faster and easier  the quarter panels can be removed without cutting them off from the roof panels  instead of being a true uni body car  there is a frame holding the majority of the car together  just like the muscle cars from thirty five years ago  most of the engine components can be accessed without having to remove others  all these and more make the car the friend of the mechanic or body shop however  on top of the ease of repairs  came the extremely high satisfaction ratings in magazines like  consumer reports  the first couple of years the car was out  saturns were ranked as high as or just below lexus  it really wasn t until the car was around five or six years old did the earliest models start to have problems fast forward to 2000  although i had almost bought a new car a few times in the past  something always happened making me keep what i had  or else getting the use of another vehicle  in the summer of 2000  i knew it was time to buy my first brand new car  i knew i wanted a coupe  and had a price range of around  20 000  my finalists were the toyota celica  the honda accord  and the saturn sc 2 the toyota was faster and seemed more comfortable  however  it was several thousand dollars more expensive  had limited options  and far fewer features than the saturn  the honda accord was noticeably faster  more comfortable  and had an even better satisfaction rating than the saturn  however  it cost almost  5000 more  has a very limited option package  and i didn t want a four door model the specifics of why i liked the saturn were because of its general features  like the third door  and the dent proof body  also  i liked what i heard about the dealerships who are almost far too eager to please  one of the biggest selling points to me was the fact that i could pick my list of options and have exactly the car i want built just for me  at every other car company  if you want the bigger engine  you probably have to pay for the deluxe model  if you want a more gas efficient engine  you probably have to sacrifice getting anything like power windows or a leather interior  not with saturn  what you want is exactly what you can get  for me  the ability to do this outweighs the savings you get by buying a two year old used car for my car  i basically got everything except for the sunroof  i didn t think that  700 option would be worth it  i did pay the same price for the leather interior  which not only makes the car more comfortable and look higher quality  but it also should really help the resale value years from now  i decided to get the combo cd and tape deck since i ve never liked the idea of having a multiple cd changer in the trunk where it is hard to get at  since it is pretty hard to easily locate and put in a new cd while driving  i may have to change my thoughts on that if i don t come across an mp3 player someday i also paid about  1200 extra for a combination anti lock brakes and traction control safety kit  one woman i met at a saturn event said she didn t pay for that since she doubted she would ever lock up her brakes more than once or twice a year  i figured if it saved me just once  it would be worth it  but that may be an individual judgement call i paid for power everything  since the air conditioner  power locks  mirrors   windows  cruise control  and keyless entry all came in a package  i was amazed at how many cars that are much more expensive don t have keyless entry  and those that do cost almost  1000 as an option  now that i ve used it for a while  i can t imagine going back to fumbling with the key in the lock one of the most distinctive features about the sc 2 is the now famous third door  all this really is  is a door on just the driver s side that opens in the opposite direction of the much longer driver s door to give easy access to the backseat  it is a clever design in that the handle for the door is actually between the two doors so there is no chance of someone in the backseat opening it up without the driver s door first being opened  also  the driver s door cannot be closed unless the third door is closed all the way so you can t recreate the  suicide  doors of the 1940 s no matter how much you want to  whenever people see what kind of car i have they always ask about the door  not having kids or the need for lots of storage in the back  i don t use it anywhere near as much as i have people asking me to show it to them another point to bring up is that whenever i open up the third door  people have always commented on how much room it looks like there is in the back seat considering it is a coupe  this is true  and even i have noticed it after being a passenger in the back of other small cars  the front seats have plenty of room too  i fit a friend who is 6 10 and 300 lbs  into the front seat  once he slid it all the way back  since his knees were straight up  he noticed that if the air bag goes off he  would be screwed  but he said he was comfortable enough for a trip of moderate length i bought my sc 2 at my local saturn dealer in san rafael in marin county in northern california  everyone at the dealership is really nice  but i had a fairly new salesperson so i didn t have to go through the photos and dealership cheer that most buyers do  i doubt it would be that annoying  but it certainly wasn t necessary  what i do like about the saturn dealership though is that every two months they have a saturn party on the weekend where they give out some quality gifts  have a good barbecue  and give a little class on the basics of the car  i also like the fact that my local dealership has a mascot feral cat that they adopted  but that is just me some car dealers may not really like to take care of you again after you ve bought the car  saturn has always done a great job of making me feel welcome for all of my service visits  every three thousand miles they give me an oil change  and every six and twelve thousand miles they do a host of other preventative maintenance checks and services  i paid extra for a 36 000 mile   3 year plan  i also paid about  1200 extra for a yearly detail inside and out  i m still not sure if this is worth it or not  consumer reports doesn t like anything like these packages  and one friend who has an older honda says that his dealership basically put lots and lots of wax on his car for a very high fee  my saturn apparently gets some sort of special leather coating on the inside  which is renewed once per year  and a professional level detail job once a year as well  i m about to bring it in for my second one  so i may have to update this to let you know how that turns out i also want to comment that whenever i bring my car in for anything  they also do a great job washing and vacuuming it  and use touch up paint for any little chips or scratches in the front of the car  they definitely want to satisfy me as much as possible here are some of the other things that i really like about this car i like the looks and the curves of the car  and what would an american car be without plenty of cup holders  there are two cup holders in the back  and two in the front  all in the middle console  the top of the center console slides forward for shorter people  the car has four wheel independent suspension  this means the car does handle well  although i find the turning ratio to be much more limited from other coupes i like the fact that it has true daytime running lights instead of just having the headlights on all the time  cars that have their headlights on all the time tend to burn out the more expensive headlights  and may be brighter than they would like for when they are just driving around  they daytime lights are on whenever the engine has been running and the car isn t in park under the hood  the dipsticks are all color coded and have large rings making them easy to grab  they are also proud of how easy it is to change the headlight bulbs  and other minor cosmetic fixes for the owner of the car  as opposed to a professional mechanic the car has great visibility from the driver s seat  no huge headrests  or odd shaped back panels to block your vision  the side view mirrors show me plenty of the roadway  and even average height people in the back seat don t block my view the car tries to make it hard for you to inconvenience yourself  if i leave the keys in the ignition and try to close the doors  it will instantly unlock as soon as it is locked  also  if i turn off the car with the headlights on  the warning bell lets me know  when you buy your car  they will also give you a credit card key to keep in your wallet in case you ever get locked out of your car and here are some of the things that i don t like about the car the trunk release and open gas tank levers are too close to one another  the traction control slightly limits the acceleration  and it is always on when you first start the car  the seatbelt gets twisted up almost every time i put it on  nothing i do seems to be able to prevent this  the antennae isn t powered  but can be screwed off for when you go through carwashes  the trunk hinges really take up a lot of room inside the trunk when you close it  limiting your available storage the electric window controls are on the middle console  this means you only need one switch for each window  but passengers always lock and unlock the doors several times before asking how to roll down the window  along a similar line  passengers always seem to adjust the auto tune when they try to change radio stations  the stereo system sounds very good for a stock stereo system  but the front of the cd radio tapedeck isn t laid out very well  i find it very hard to work the radio without looking at it  all the buttons feel the same  and are hard to read at night for the most part the dashboard is large and easily read  however  a minor complaint i have is that i have to switch between the digital trip odometer and the normal odometer instead of showing me both at once like older car s rolling wheel odometers some people think the car has a lot of power  and many people think it is gutless  i stand right in the middle  and think the car is pretty average  it isn t quite fast enough for me off of the line  and it goes more than fast enough when accelerating onto the freeway  one unusual trick i learned from the guys at the dealership however  is that having the traction control on limits the acceleration when the gas pedal is floored  i don t know or understand why  turning it off gives me a noticeably higher rate of acceleration  so sometimes i ll turn it off before i pass someone  i think that since the car is so light  plastic body panels  that having more people in the car affects the acceleration more than it would another vehicle  so people feel like it has less power  that s just my theory the third door also has one large problem  many people comment on the fact that they wish it was on the other side for where you would install a child safety seat  this may be true  but i would think you could put it on either side just as easy  however  i do know that since the driver s door has to open up in order to get the third door open  this makes it almost worthless when parking in a parking lot with a car next to you  i would like to use it the most when i am shopping and want to put my groceries in the backseat  this can t be done unless you have an empty parking space next to you a common complaint i read about this car is that it is noisy  i believe this is possible because of the plastic body not shielding the driver from the roadway  this may be true  but i have never really been distracted by any outside noises  nor do i expect a car to be soundproof from the outside world saturns come with a 1900cc engine that has either 8 or 16 heads giving you either 100 or 124 horsepower  the reported mileage is 25 in the city or 36 on the highway  add two to each if you buy a manual instead of an automatic transmission  this seems fairly accurate as i average between 24 and 28 mpg depending on how much highway driving i am doing  mostly  i am driving in commute traffic so i don t really get to appreciate above 30 mpg conditions my car only had one defect when i purchased it  and it took me a while to notice it enough to take it in to be repaired  i had a squeak coming from the rear when i went over a speed bump  my passenger side rear strut had a squeak  i took it in  and they replaced it without any problem in about an hour another thing i should mention is that i got the car before the side head curtain airbags were available  not sure if they are worth the extra cost  but some people would rather pay for safety than anything else another thing to compliment saturn on is their web site  check it out  because they make it very easy to see the different models  to see the available options  and it will even let you get some accurate pricing with an interactive web page overall  i think that anyone who has one of these cars is happy with it  i m not saying there aren t better cars out there  but you will have to get up to the  25 000 price range before you can get behind the wheel of one of

307,auto, first off  this is a sports car  two words  sports car  this car is  not  for someone looking for a cost effective means of transportation  this car is for the enthusiast  with the exception of the 6 cylinder model  the mustang has dominated its car class since 1965 and still retains its position as the best sports car on the market for several reasons  it s fast  reliable  and above all  a blast to drive  the gas mileage isn t great  but when you re looking to buy a sports car gas mileage shouldn t be an issue  its not a low humming 4 cylinder so don t expect it to use gas like one  as with purchasing any car  you have to do your homework before you jump in head first  hopefully  this review will help you along the way  the only predominant problem with the  94 mustang is that the fuel pump will go out after about 5 or 6 years of regular driving  but if you plan on buying one in the near future chances are that it has already been replaced  i have read reports of other things going bad  but for the most part these are isolated scenarios  i ve talked with enough experienced drivers and mechanics to know that the mustang is one of the most reliable sports cars on the road today  mine hasn t failed me yet and i know well over 15 other people that can say the same about their present and past  stangs  mustangs are built tough and they last  handling isn t the best  but then again a mustang isn t a porsche  it s a muscle car  you ll never be able to drop the clutch in a porsche the way you can in a mustang  even camaro s  as hard as they try  will never come close to touching the feeling  sound  and experience of driving a mustang  every time i start my car i get excited and every time i turn it off and get out  i can t help but just stare at it  it s definitely an eye catcher  the one thing that convinced me to buy this car is its get up and go power  just knowing that i can pass someone without even thinking about it is a good feeling  this is definitely a car that will grow on you with time  its smooth and well defined body hides a monstrous v8 beast  it s true that this is one of the mustang s slower years  it comes after the 235hp  93 model and 2 years prior to the introduction of the modular 4 6l v8  but don t let that fool you  note  the  94 gt has 215hp and an estimated city mpg of 17  this car is by all means a force to be reckoned with  if you re an experienced driver  driving in the rain should be no problem  if you re not an experienced driver and you re worried about driving it in the rain  just take it easy and she ll handle just fine  the one and only thing i ve found to be discomforting about this car on the interstate is that at high speeds in the rain it tends to hydroplane on and off depending on road and weather conditions  one highlight  however  is that the  94 mustang handles much better than the preceding foxbody style mustang  89 93  and hydroplanes much less as a result  consider this car a two seater and the back seat as storage space  if you want passenger space that is comfortable  look into buying a sedan instead of a coupe  i haven t had any complaints about the back seat as of yet  but it seems to be the popular opinion that mustang back seats are uncomfortable and cramped  i mention this only for your own good  all of the controls are placed within easy access of the driver and the electronic seat function lumbar support can make you feel like a king once you ve adjusted it properly  the interior feels more like a cockpit than anything else  another thing i would like to touch on is the fact that the mustang has a very high safety rating  as long as you don t wrap it around a tree  you won t be in for as much damage as you might be with other cars in the same class  i only mention this to cover all the different aspects of the  94 mustang  i would also like to note that the car s automatic transmission is not weak  i ve seen several complaints about the transmission being weak and false rumors that the reason the cobra doesn t come with an optional 4 speed automatic is because the transmission wouldn t be able to handle it  the cobra doesn t have an automatic transmission because it s a cobra and most high end sports cars are bought with a 5 speed transmission  not a clunking 4 speed automatic  my mustang is peaking 64 thousand miles and i haven t had any problems since i purchased it other than the fuel pump which i mentioned earlier  it runs smooth and still has the pony spirit that is synonymous with the mustang name  lastly  remember there is nothing like a mustang and you won t be able to understand it until you ve driven one  i won t even try to put it into words because i can t  if you re looking into this car as a possible purchase in the near future  go to your local dealership and test drive one  but make sure it s a gt  i also recommend finding a 5 speed as it yields much more power than an automatic transmission will ever dream of pulling from the car s 302 cubic inch engine  ,first sport car two word sport car car someone look cost effective mean transportation car enthusiast exception cylinder model dominate car class

308,camera, my wife and i had been shopping for a digital camera for months  but were waiting for some extra cash before buying one  i wanted at least 3 mp and had planned on spending over  300  well  when wal mart advertised a 6 hour  after thanksgiving sale  and had this kodak 3 2 mp camera for  154  i jumped at the opportunity  we have been very happy with this camera and the pictures that it takes  the only disadvantage is that there is no optical zoom and the digital zoom is fairly useless  however  i have overcome this problem by planning my shots better and then editing them with photo software  i recently took a second business trip to copenhagen  denmark and took this camera along  i had taken pictures on my first trip there with an aps camera  while my first set of pictures was ok  it could not compare to the quality from the digital camera  plus  with a 64mb card  i could take dozens of pictures without the worry of film  with this camera  i have also learned how to extend the battery life so that it is not a factor when taking pictures all day  i shut off the  instant review  feature and the  live shot  feature  as these are big drains on the batteries  then  i just download all of the pictures when i m done and delete or edit the bad ones while this is by no means a  professional  camera  it is very good for the average home photographer  if it can still be found at a low price  i would highly recommend it  that is  of course  unless someone wants to spend double the amount for a similar camera with an optical zoom i would also like to add that  as opposed to other reviewers  i have not had any problems with my lens cap   0  ,wife shop digital camera months wait extra cash buy one want least plan spend well mary advertise hour thanksgiving sale today camera jump opportunity happy camera picture take disadvantage optical room digital room fairly useless however overcome problem plan shots better edit photo software recently take second business trip copenhagen denmark take camera along take picture first trip camera first set picture ok could compare quality digital camera plus mb card could take dozens picture without worry film camera also learn extend battery life factor take picture day shut instant review feature live shoot feature big drain batteries download picture do delete edit bad ones mean professional camera good average home photographer still find low price would highly recommend course unless someone want spend double amount similar camera optical room would also like add oppose review problems lens cap

310,auto, after i had purchased 5 used vehicles in 5 years  and putting more than  15 000 into upkeep and repairs  i decided to look at a new car  it was purely by chance i was standing in the used car lot at incredible auto in billings  mt when i turned to the salesman and asked him   what kind of deal can you make me on a new kia  and so the story begins  this was in july of 2000 and i remembered i had heard several comments on kias  some fair  but mostly were good  after wheeling and dealing for about 45 min  i drove off the lot with a brand new 2000 violet mist kia sephia  with an snazzy looking wood dash kit from the factory  really spices up the interior  then and now  out here at least  kias come with a 10 year 100 000 mile power train warranty and an additional 5 year 36 000 mile roadside assistance warranty  i drive 140 miles each day just to get to and from work and home  this is why i needed an economical and trust worthy vehicle  my first tank of gas i got 36 mpg  since then it has averaged out to 26 30 mpg   this is winter gas  and this is with starting the car and leaving it running for 10 45 min while i m in the store  house  or it s warming up  these are necessary actions in  40 deg  weather the only drawbacks i have experienced since i bought the car was that the paint on the hood  not warranted  chipped very easily  after 3 weeks  approx  900 miles  there were numerous rock chips in the paint  how do you fix it  i bought a front end mask that really sharpens the look of this car up a lot and also added protection for the paint  also  after about 10 000 miles i noticed that my gas mileage was significantly dropping  last friday night my  check engine  light turned on and later went off again  i took it to the dealership and the o2  oxygen sensor is faulty  easy to fix  still safe to drive  and part will be in early next week  no sweat  the stereo isn t the highest quality and there are no wire harnesses made for installing after market decks  however a reliable shop will t tap into the existing harness with little or no trouble i am not the wealthiest of people  and cannot afford the time or money required to maintain another used vehicle  and haven t had to do so  i would say  i got a great car for a great price  without compromising anything  ,purchase use vehicles years put upkeep repair decide look new car purely chance stand use car lot incredible auto will mt turn salesman ask kind deal make new kit story begin july remember hear several comment kiss fair mostly good wheel deal min drive lot brand new violet mist kit sophia snazzy look wood dash kit factory really space interior least kiss come year mile power train warranty additional year mile roadside assistance warranty drive miles day get work home need economical trust worthy vehicle first tank gas get pg since average pg winter gas start car leave run min store house warm necessary action de weather drawback experience since buy car paint hood warrant whip easily weeks approve miles numerous rock chip paint fix buy front end mask really sharpen look car lot also add protection paint also miles notice gas mileage significantly drop last friday night check engine light turn later go take leadership oxygen senior faulty easy fix still safe drive part early next week sweat sterno highest quality wire harness make instal market deck however reliable shop tap exist harness little trouble wealthiest people afford time money require maintain another use vehicle would say get great car great price without compromise anything
311,auto, i bought my 1998 dodge dakota 4cyl  in november of 1997  i have enjoyed my truck for the most part  although it has needed a few repairs here and there  the repair that has been the most bothersome is due to a flaw in the bolts holding the exhaust manifold to the engine  when i first experienced problems with these bolts  the service department at the local dodge dealership had a large amount of difficulty finding the problem  second time around  the problem was diagnosed immediately the truck is somewhat underpowered  although it is sufficient to tow my boat  it does seem to lag when the air conditioning is turned on i bought this truck to satisfy my need for a vehicle that is both reliable and useful  on both of these points it has done rather well i thoroughly enjoy its responsiveness and handling  but wish that the repair that was done on it would not continue to occur i would recommend that if you are considering buying a dakota  that you overbuy on engine size  as the cost is rather insignificant  and there are plenty of larger engines in the dakota lineup i will be buying another dakota soon i want the 4 door  and the big engine next time though br br  ,buy dodge dakota cy november enjoy truck part although need repair repair bothersome due flaw bolt hold exhaust manifold engine first experience problems bolt service department local dodge leadership large amount difficulty find problem second time around problem diagnose immediately truck somewhat underpowered although sufficient tow boat seem law air condition turn buy truck satisfy need vehicle reliable useful point do rather well thoroughly enjoy responsiveness handle wish repair do would continue occur would recommend consider buy dakota overrun engine size cost rather insignificant plenty larger engines dakota line buy another dakota soon want door big engine next time though br
312,camera, i acquired this camera as a christmas present in 2002  at first i was extremely excited at finally getting a good camera  as my previous camera was just an intel webcam  naturally  it was the first new toy i played with b first look  upon opening the box  the first thing i noticed was the lack of ac adapter for the camera   no big deal  i thought   i have my own universal adapter  instead of digging it out  i grab a pair of aa batteries to use  once i m going  i take about 10 15 pictures with the flash and lcd screen going before they end up completely drained  while changing out the batteries for another pair  which annoyed me  i get bumped by my cousin in his new big wheel  which causes me to drop my precious new camera  it survived the fall except for the front blue plate  which promptly decided to pop off  that was no big deal either  a few drops of super glue and i was once again on my way b continued use  since then  i ve used it a total of about 3 4 times a month to take pictures of various events or on trips  so far the quality is still high  i ve been taking care of it  so no more physical problems have arisen  i use it for a webcam mostly  since i hate having to constantly change batteries  that way i m able to just leave it connected to an ac adapter b nitpicks  as you ve read above  the battery life rather irks me  i should be able to take many more pictures before having to change batteries  granted  having a device that is completely electronic tends to draw more power  but if you can have a cd player with a cd spinning constantly for several hours on nothing but two aa batteries  how come this camera can t take more than 15 pictures  there s obviously some power consumption issues with the parts p another nitpick would be the construction of the case  the plastic looks a little toyish and can probably easily crack if you dropped it on something such as cement  i know they were going for a portable sized camera here  but the construction looks a bit more shoddy than it probably should be p something else i ve noticed recently is the amount of blur in the picture  if you don t have the camera completely still or if you re moving  such as in a car  the image can be blurred heavily  i noticed this when i tried taking surprise pictures of friends  i d stick the camera out about 4 feet in front of their face and snap the picture  but they d come out with a weird blurred effect  which still baffles me since i d have the camera fairly still before hitting the shutter button b overall  this camera would probably be fine for a younger person who just wishes to take normal everyday pictures or use it as a webcam  for anyone else who wishes to have a quality camera to take vacationing or to use for long periods of time may wish to opt for a better camera in the price range or pay extra for better quality and battery life  while i m not complaining since i received the camera as a gift  i wish to let anyone else looking to buy this camera a heads up on its features and drawbacks  ,acquire camera christmas present first extremely excite finally get good camera previous camera inter webcam naturally first new toy play first look upon open box first thing notice lack ac adapt camera big deal think universal adapt instead dig grab pair batteries use go take picture flash lead screen go end completely drain change batteries another pair annoy get bump cousin new big wheel cause drop precious new camera survive fall except front blue plate promptly decide pop big deal either drop super blue way continue use since use total time month take picture various events trip far quality still high take care physical problems arise use webcam mostly since hate constantly change batteries way able leave connect ac adapt nitpick read battery life rather irs able take many picture change batteries grant device completely electronic tend draw power player spin constantly several hours nothing two batteries come camera take picture obviously power consumption issue part another nitric would construction case plastic look little boyish probably easily crack drop something cement know go portable size camera construction look bite shoe probably something else notice recently amount blur picture camera completely still move car image blur heavily notice try take surprise picture friends stick camera feet front face snap picture come weird blur effect still baffle since camera fairly still hit shutter button overall camera would probably fine younger person wish take normal everyday picture use webcam anyone else wish quality camera take vacation use long periods time may wish opt better camera price range pay extra better quality battery life complain since receive camera gift wish let anyone else look buy camera head feature drawback

315,camera, having shot close to 2 000 pictures in the last month and a half with this camera  take my word for it  the coolpix 5700 is an excellent camera  it does have a few limitations  but few cameras can compare to it in the bang for bucks stakes  lets start off with the negatives first  1  at anything above iso 200 film speed the pictures start showing a lot of noise  this however is true with almost all digital cameras  however if you get a regular sized printout of your picture the noise is not that apparent  blowing up the picture is another matter though  also if you re always going to keep the camera on auto mode  you need not worry about this problem  the folks at nikon know the limitations of the camera and don t let it go into higher film speed modes in automatic mode 2  the enormous amounts of options  menus  buttons etc  can be bewildering at first  again if you re only pointing and shooting on auto mode  this is not that worrisome a problem  and honestly i bought the camera specifically because it had so many options 3  the 32 mb card included with the camera is way too small  256 mb would have been better  ibm s 1gb microdrive is best 4  in low light conditions the coolpix gets confused and finds it hard to focus quickly  migrating from a film based slr  also a nikon  i found this problem to be a bit annoying  also the coolpix is not happy taking action or sports shots which require quickness from the camera and that s about it  everything else about the camera is fantastic  it has an amazing 8x zoom lens  35 280 mm  and with the optional telephoto lens this can be extended to 420 mm  candid photography reaches a new level with this camera  the picture quality is awesome  and if you are really into photography  playing with all the options available in the user modes is great fun  i personally have one mode set up for black   white pictures  another one for continuous picture taking and the third one for manually adjusting the aperture and shutter speeds  the other digital camera i own is a minolta dimage f100  even though that is a great little camera its biggest fault is the fact that it uses up batteries like there s no tomorrow  with the nikon that problem is solved by the rechargable en el1 battery  which can operate for about 2 hours continuously and can take about 150 pictures on one charge  i was put off with evf  electronic viewfinder  initially  as it cannot compare to an slr s view  but i ve gotten used to it overtime and i find that it actually works quite well  and there s always the option to use the highly adjustable lcd monitor at the back and the best thing about it is ofcourse the versatility that only a digital camera can provide  you take a picture  look at it  say ah ah this is not exactly what i wanted  tweak the settings try again  and so on  until you get that perfect picture in summary  the coolpix 5700 has all the goodies you d expect from one of the best camera manufacturers in the world  don t buy it as a replacement for an slr because it isn t  though it comes close  it is simply the best prosumer digital camera out there  and in my case it has made me a better photographer than i ever was before  i think that should be praise enough  ,shoot close picture last month half camera take word coolpix excellent camera limitations camera compare bang buck stake let start negative first anything iso film speed picture start show lot noise however true almost digital camera however get regular size printout picture noise apparent blow picture another matter though also always go keep camera auto mode need worry problem folks union know limitations camera let go higher film speed modes automatic mode enormous amount option venus button etc bewilder first point shoot auto mode wearisome problem honestly buy camera specifically many option mb card include camera way small mb would better ism go microdrive best low light condition coolpix get confuse find hard focus quickly migration film base sir also union find problem bite annoy also coolpix happy take action sport shots require quickness camera everything else camera fantastic amaze room lens mm optional telephone lens extend mm candid photography reach new level camera picture quality awesome really photography play option available user modes great fun personally one mode set black white picture another one continuous picture take third one mentally adjust aperture shutter speed digital camera minorca damage even though great little camera biggest fault fact use batteries like tomorrow union problem solve rechargable en el battery operate hours continuously take picture one charge put eve electronic viewfinder initially compare sir view get use overcome find actually work quite well always option use highly adjustable lead monitor back best thing course versatility digital camera provide take picture look say ah exactly want weak settings try get perfect picture summary coolpix body expect one best camera manufacturers world buy replacement sir though come close simply best presume digital camera case make better photographer ever think praise enough
316,camera, i am fairly new to the digital camera world but i did a lot of research for a client who was looking to buy  while looking for his camera i found the canon a20 along with others but the canon always won out in the reviews  it didn t meet my clients needs  however  it would meet mine  so i decided after about 2 months of reading reviews and talking to owners  sellers  etc  to give it a try  i m glad i did too  i am running win xp professional at home and this has created a little havoc with other software  not for the canon a20  i loaded the drivers and after taking a few shots plugged it in and whammo it found the camera and asked me what to do  this is one of the easiest to use cameras i have ever owned  i did however spend the money and buy the rayovac model ps4 1 hr fast battery recharger and nimh batteries  it doesn t eat them as quickly as it does regular batteries  i also bought an additional 64 mb sandisk memory card  which is cheaper than the kodak memory cards  the old saying holds true  you get what you pay for  i would recommend this camera to anyone who is new to the digital world  ,fairly new digital camera world lot research client look buy look camera find canon along others canon always review meet clients need however would meet mine decide months read review talk owners sellers etc give try glad run win professional home create little havoc software canon load drivers take shots plug whammo find camera ask one easiest use camera ever own however spend money buy rayovac model fast battery recharger nigh batteries eat quickly regular batteries also buy additional mb sand memory card cheaper today memory card old say hold true get pay would recommend camera anyone new digital world
317,auto,  the 1992 ford taurus  was now in its 2nd generation  many car companies for 1992 had revised their sedans to look more aerodynamic  so ford had to do something to stay on top in the style department  unfortunately this attempt resulted in a more blase look  the 1992 ford taurus  while improved in some areas  never made it past 1st base in other areas   the 1992 ford taurus  is not much different than the 1991 models  the 2 4 liter  90 horse powered engine is finally dropped  but there still is an anemic 140 horsepower 3 0 vulcan v6 as its base engine  the 1992 also weighs more than its predecessor  tipping the scales for the first time over 3 100lbs  the next engine is the essex 3 8 engine  it too has 140 horsepower  but unlike the vulcan 3 0 it gets all its power at a much lower rpm  and has more torque  215lb ft  the top of the line engine is the 3 0 dohc engine that was built partly by ford  and mostly by yamaha in japan  this engine cranks out an impressive 220 horsepower  and will burn rubber if you don t watch your right foot at a stop light  this engine unfortunately is only available in the top of the line  sho  models  and they only come with a 5 speed manual for this year  the axod transmission still  after thousands of complaints  comes in the gl and lx models with the ohv 3 0 and 3 8 engine  ford obviously did not listen to their customers very well i driving impressions i   t he lx equipped with the 3 0 is what most of the critics called  anemic   boring  and just  plain sad  this lack of power problem was obviously an issue that i did not share alone  this car not only was slow in the lightweight models of the mid 1980s  but for 1992 it s even slower with the added weight and no increase in engine power  the 1992 ford taurus  of course is not a race car  however shouldn t  acceleration  onto the freeway at a decent pace be a standard amenity in an almost  20 000 family car  i think so  remember  when these cars were new they were not exactly cheap  some lx models were as much as  21 000  a good engine  with adequate power is not asking too much  is it  my test car  a 1992 lx only had 82 000 miles on it  but felt like it had much more  there were tears in the headliner and vanity mirrors  the carpet was worn  the back seat had tears in the cheap leather  this car looked as though it had been through the war  there was even a time while accelerating up hill that the transmission totally slipped out of gear  i had to shift to neutral then back to d  after letting off of the gas pedal  the transmission let itself go back into high gear  and i resumed my way up the hill at around 45 mph on the freeway  very dangerous when the speed limit is 80  but i had no choice i interior accommodation i  the  interior  is not too bad  i ve never personally been in a 92 taurus when it was brand new  lets see  in 1992 i was around 14 years old  but i can imagine what this car probably looked like  the leather probably looked plush  the headliner fitted like a nice pair of leather pants  and the transmission as silky smooth as my skin  that s me trying to be funny  anyway enough about probably s  this car is now 10 years old and it is pretty darn close to what many would consider junk  the interior does boast tons of room  trunk room included  there is 6 way power seats with lumbar support as an option for the lx  leather  a cold ac  an optional electronic dash  electric antenna  5 mph bumpers  front air bags  finally  abs is an option  the 6 speaker ford sound system probably would have been good  but it didn t work so i can t comment   exterior innovation i  the  exterior  looks much like the 1st generation s  the rear looks a little more square  there is modified tail lights and head lights  body colored bumpers and door handles  more attractive stock rims  and paint has been revised so it doesn t wash off as easy as the previous 1st generation models  when i say  wash off  in a number of cases this actually happened with first generation ford taurus i price i  the  price  for a 1992 lx taurus will cost you around 3 000 dollars  in many cases these cars are being given away  or close to it

319,auto, out of boredom  i went to test drive an xterra  i had done some research on the nissan website  so i knew a lot about the truck to begin with  i did not plan on buying anything for another year  i had the salesman go with me on the test drive  and i asked questions on everything  it s roomy on the inside  and has compartments everywhere  anyway  i was pretty impressed with the answers he gave  i saw a terrain area and decided to test the 4x4  when i got back on the highway  i put it back in 2x4 and heard the brush falling out from the bottom of the truck  i gave the salesman my checkbook right there i bought the xe  with the sport  utility and power packages  some nice extras that i like  the power to the windows stays on for a few minutes after the key is out of the ignition  also  for short people like myself  there is a handle to pull the hatch down  not to mention the window shade to hide your gear  the back seats come out for more room  and the back seats sit up high  so your back seat drivers can have a clear view  the truck is very roomy  i bought 5 bookcases today  and fit them all in the truck in one trip  it fits all of your gear  groceries  work stuff  and other junk now the cons  in my opinion  these are minor  if you put the back windows down while you re on the expressway  you get a helicoptor sound  due to the roof rack  wind buffet  of course  the gas mileage sucks compared to a car  but the gas tank is only about 15 gallons so you re not spending your paycheck at the gas station  this is expected for an suv  the back windows only go down half way  my personal pet peeve with most cars  finally  it s such a good truck that you see them everywhere you go overall  it s a great suv that handles like a truck  it will look good on you  and you ll turn heads when driving go  head but it  ,boredom go test drive externa do research nissan webster know lot truck begin plan buy anything another year salesman go test drive ask question everything room inside compartments everywhere anyway pretty impress answer give saw terrain area decide test get back highway put back hear brush fall bottom truck give salesman checkbook right buy sport utility power package nice extra like power windows stay minutes key munition also short people like handle pull watch mention window shade hide gear back seat come room back seat sit high back seat drivers clear view truck room buy bookcases today fit truck one trip fit gear groceries work stuff june sons opinion minor put back windows expressly get helicopter sound due roof rack wind buffet course gas mileage suck compare car gas tank gallows spend paycheck gas station expect sun back windows go half way personal pet nerve cars finally good truck see everywhere go overall great sun candle like truck look good turn head drive go head
320,auto, the dodge neon has a cute look but behind that cute look there are many problems  i was 18 and my parents were buying me my first car  we were immediately attracted to the cute look and the price  i thought it was the ultimate chick mobile  i soon found out that looks can be very deceiving i had bought a 1997 neon and my nightmare started at about 9 000 miles  my car would actually accelerate on its own  at least that is what i like to say  but it really did  the engine would race and the car would actually accelerate even if i had my foot on the break  the car was taken back to the dealer too many times to count and they tried replacing everything because they didn t know what it was  to make it worse they tried to make me pay for all of it  but the car was still under warranty and my dad had to fight with dodge to make them pay for it  they replaced just about everything but nothing fixed this car  i truly believe that it was lemon  i finally had to get rid of the car because things were getting so bad  i honestly felt that the car was unsafe to drive  the dodge dealership that we went to was not very helpful at all they didn t go out of their way to help us  i was never provided with a rental car for any of the times it was at the dealership  on many occassions it was at the dealership for many days  i don t feel that the service department or dogde in general handled my case very well  i have never heard anyone who owns a neon say anything good about it  the only good thing about it was that it got good gas mileage  but the bad things definitely out weighted the good things br br  ,dodge non cut look behind cut look many problems parent buy first car immediately attract cut look price think ultimate thick mobile soon find look deceive buy non nightmare start miles car would actually accelerate least like say really engine would race car would actually accelerate even foot break car take back dealer many time count try replace everything know make worse try make pay car still warranty dad fight dodge make pay replace everything nothing fix car truly believe lemon finally get rid car things get bad honestly felt car safe drive dodge leadership go helpful go way help us never provide rental car time leadership many occasion leadership many days feel service department dodge general handle case well never hear anyone own non say anything good good thing get good gas mileage bad things definitely weight good things br
321,camera, i highly recommend people to get this camera i had a hard time with all the other camera s i ve bought but this one really comes in handy first of all it s a small camera which can be put anywhere like in your pocket this is great so you don t have to carry it around all the time  also the pictures come out very clear and if you don t like the way it looks you can delete the picture and try again  with other camera s you d have to wait till after you payed for the film to be developed to get back pictures that came out horrible  i ve had that experience with one of the camera s i used on vacation  i expected my pictures to come out great but after i got them back they came out blurry or to much to the side with the canon digital you get clear shots and you won t have to worry about getting back bad pictures another thing that s good about this camera is that you can transfer pictures from the camera to a scanner on the computer  for example  my brother just had a baby and i have an aunt that lives in california  what we did was put the pictures from the digital onto the scanner and sent them to her through e mail  all in less then a few hours  ,highly recommend people get camera hard time camera buy one really come handy first small camera put anywhere like pocket great carry around time also picture come clear like way look delete picture try camera wait till play film develop get back picture come horrible experience one camera use vacation expect picture come great get back come flurry much side canon digital get clear shots worry get back bad picture another thing good camera transfer picture camera scan computer example brother baby aunt live california put picture digital onto scan send mail less hours
322,camera, my husband bought me this fuji camera for me  i buy and sell alot on ebay and with all the photos i had to take  he thought this would be better  i was leary  digital i said  sounds complicated the camera is lightweight  silver in color and not a lot of buttons or dials to work with  it comes with softwear to hook it right up to your computer  which we did so we started by playing around and you know it is fun the view finder is nice and can act like a video view finder showing everything in front of it even as you move  i like this feature alot it has only two modes for pictures one is normal and then magnified 2x  it is easy and has an automatic flash and focus abilities  it has red eye reduction and a little hand to help you with shakiness when you go to take your picture you have two lights red or green  of course green is go  and then you click the shutter button and you take the pic  wait maybe 2 seconds and in the view finder is the picture you just took  now is the fun part don t like it trash it  yep  you can get rid of it and do it again  i like that a lot  not that i take bad pics but  hey  we are not all perfect after you take your pictures you go to you computer and attach the plug to your camera and go to the program and it is so easy to transfer pictures from the disc  to the puter  the worst part of this is i use batteries and this stage eats the batteries very fast  so an ac adapter is a must for this  i like the camera and very happy my husband thought of me to buy it  he bought me a lap top two years ago  he now has it at work for his business check with me in two years to see who has the camera lol  gotta love them  huh ladies   br br  ,husband buy full camera buy sell clot bay photo take think would better weary digital say sound complicate camera lightweight silver color lot button deal work come softer hook right computer start play around know fun view finder nice act like video view finder show everything front even move like feature clot two modes picture one normal magnify easy automatic flash focus abilities red eye reduction little hand help sharpness go take picture two light red green course green go click shutter button take pick wait maybe second view finder picture take fun part like trash yep get rid like lot take bad pick hey perfect take picture go computer attach plug camera go program easy transfer picture disc peter worst part use batteries stage eat batteries fast ac adapt must like camera happy husband think buy buy lap top two years ago work business check two years see camera gutta love hut ladies br
323,auto, this is a medium performance car that i enjoy having and driving  at 136hp  i just love that overdrive button when getting on the highway  the seats can be set to be just comfortable enough to enjoy a long ride  but not too much to fall asleep on them  i admit it doesn t have a spheric  chromatic feeling like most compact cars  but it s a car that gets me from point a to point b quick and efficiently living in quebec  cars need winter tires  i was using this car on all season tires all year long  and managed to never have a single accident  i did happen to make 2 consecutive 180s in a curve when driving to my friend s house one night  a clockwise 180  the car was propelled backwards  so i hit the neutral and managed to make a counter clockwise 180 and put drive back on  it also happened on the high way that i almost lost control  but thanks to the manoeuvrability of this car  i was able to make it safely  the same night about 20 or so accidents related to the weather were reported in the area this car can nicely take curves and bumps  and i feel comfortable using a constant speed in areas where most people don t  including a curve formely famous for deadly accidents  the built in stereo is of medium class  well  it would be considered good for a  94 i guess  the cassette player had to go  so i put money aside and put in a cd player and a new antenna  new music i get the buzz station better than most of my friends  the speakers work great even with my new radio all the parts are really easy to get  all parts i need fix  i can get the very same day  even on weekends  the downside of this car is it s engine  i m not much of a mechanic  but lots of my friends are  since it s a japanese car  the parts are very packed together  lucky thing my friend new a garagist who new himself in these  it took him a solid 90 minutes to fix my starter since everything was jammed up together  other bad thing are the cup holders  i can t have a cup without blocking the vent control system ontop and the ashtray under  which my mother needs when smoking b stats  horse power  136 mileage  just over 173 000 kilometers common destinations  dance clubs

around the wheels under the car  to prevent dirt from entering and breaking the parts  ruptured the starter failed on me the hood latch got stuck  so had to drive a few miles at low speed  having chances of the hood deciding to let go  just needed some wd 40 and pryers to fix  the wire was loose the trunk cannot be opened by inside the car  it has to be opened by key my key is somewhat broken  the car can run  even if i take my key out while it s running b recommendations  since this is a 2 door car  it s obviously not a family car  i would say it s a practible car for going to work or groceries  and would be mostly of good usage for a single person or a couple make a casual check on it and you ll be satisfied  i haven t done any checkups  and it started acting up on me replace that

325,camera, i received my d 600l last christmas as a gift  and since that time i have used it for a wide variety of scenes  landscapes  seascapes  family in the home and on our farm  houses under various lighting conditions  and even some  quot artsy quot  shots of people outdoors and under natural low light and flash conditions indoors  it takes good pictures in terms of resolution  and the cable transfer from the camera to my computer of up to 12 images at a time has been flawless  however  there are a couple of annoying problems i have had  the first relates to the auto focus and fact that the camera will not shoot a picture if the autofocus says the scene is not in focus and yet it will not find the target at close ranges  so i have to back way up and try it again and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt  very frustrating the second problem is a pretty common one  very very short battery life  i don t know why they don t put rechargeable batteries in here and give you a charger  if i m lucky  i can get about 20 shots taken and transferred for each set of 4aa batteries  which is pretty poor br br  ,receive last christmas gift since time use wide variety scenes landscape escape family home farm house various light condition even quit arts quit shots people outdoor natural low light flash condition indoors take good picture term resolution cable transfer camera computer image time lawless however couple annoy problems first relate auto focus fact camera shoot picture autofocus say scene focus yet find target close range back way try sometimes work sometimes frustration second problem pretty common one short battery life know put rechargeable batteries give charge lucky get shots take transfer set batteries pretty poor br
326,camera, no doubt  this is one of the best consumer digital cameras that are out there  the camera features both auto and manual modes  i have mostly used the auto function  and sure it takes exceptionally sharp pictures in different light conditions  i have taken some very close up shots and the auto mode handles it very well  the manual mode will give you full control of your shots  it comes with a lexar 16mb flash card  you can save images in three different modes  basic  normal and fine  with basic you can get almost 44 images on a 16mb cf  with normal about 21 images and with fine about 12 images  one thing i don t like about the camera is it s size  it is a bit too big in size  it is a bit heavy too  i don t like the swivel lens also  you will probably have to use both hands to hold it to take shots  a better alternative would be nikon coolpix 880  but as far as camera capabilities and picture quality are concerned this one will be hard to beat     ,doubt one best consumer digital camera camera feature auto manual modes mostly use auto function sure take exceptionally sharp picture different light condition take close shots auto mode candle well manual mode give full control shots come bexar mb flash card save image three different modes basic normal fine basic get almost image mb cf normal image fine image one thing like camera size bite big size bite heavy like wive lens also probably use hand hold take shots better alternative would union coolpix far camera capabilities picture quality concern one hard beat
327,camera, i ve been an internet user for years and have only begun to see the popularity of webcams a year back or so  everyone and their mother had their grainy pictures plastered in one place or another of this virtual realm  but where was i  faceless  nowhere to be seen  oh  the drama  then i bought a webcam so i can do the same  after using that for about a few months  i find webcams to be of somewhat low quality and generally produce pictures that are unattractive  which led to my purchase of the   fuji finepix a101    it was a fine choice and soon  i had no use for that pitiful webcam  this digital camera is easy and fun to use and it s also very convenient  the price  one may think  is a very good price   at  150 or so  it sure beats out the other entry level digital cameras in the market    151 in the box  151  the   fuji finepix a101   digital camera comes with the following things to get you set up and ready to go     the camera itself    a silver  lightweight  5 1 oz  photographic device with simple navigational buttons   8 mb smartmedia memory card    a lot to say for something so tiny    usb cable    a short cable to transfer the image and video files into your computer   software cd rom    nothing too fancy here  photo transfer printing software and drivers   instruction manuals    for those who can t figure out how the camera works just by looking at it   two aa batteries    the ones provided are not very useful  but a nice gesture nonetheless   wrist strap    needs no description b 151 the specs  151  b i fuji finepix a101   is a  1 3 mega pixel  camera  and trust me  1 3 mega pixels is quite enough for everyday pictures  being rather small with dimensions of  3 9 x 2 5 x 1 6 in i  you can easily fit them into your pocket or purse  the listed specs are  auto exposure  auto manual  6 modes  white balance  4 modes flash system  a fixed focus and 2 0x digital zoom with a focus range of 2 feet to infinity  on the back of the camera is a 1 6 inch color lcd screen for a decent view of the images  for picture quality  you can choose to photograph at 2 resolutions   fine  at 1280x960 and  normal  at 640x480  there s also  basic  in 24 bit color  you can also capture about 20 seconds of video at 320x240 resolution at 10 frames per second  i wouldn t really recommend that since the resolution is fairly poor and there is no sound  there s also an extra feature called the  fuji advanced color technology   designed give your pictures better color depth and more detail  in addition  the camera easily doubles as a webcam using your usb cable and port whew   on  to the review    151 what the hell is so great about it   151  i easy interface      fuji finepix a101   has very user friendly interface  meaning you won t have to wonder what all those buttons are for  seeing the more advanced digital cameras with a thousand little buttons makes me afraid   what if i pressed something and it breaks  well  no worries here  just a quick run through of the manual and a bit of tinkering around will get you comfortable with how the camera works   and you ll be taking pictures in no time   features    the features are very basic since it s a point and shoot camera  but i ve had no troubles so far with what it has  the pictures rarely come out over  or underexposed and it has a very good focus  the red eye reduction has never been put to use since i haven t had run into that problem  the lcd display is big enough to get a good view of the pictures and  everything just works well    quality    as far as picture quality goes  the   fuji finepix a101   definitely met expectations  as soon as i was out of the electronics store  i started snapping photos of everything i see and went home to view them on my computer  i m no expert at photography  so i don t know much about lighting and exposure and what not  even the subjects of my pictures tend to be rather stupid  but everything came out bright and highly detailed with beautiful contrast and true to life color  even at lower resolutions  there wasn t something amiss  you ll be able to fit a lot into a single picture and retain good quality   see bottom of my review for links to sample photos i software    the camera comes with a software bundle with the required drivers and basic programs to install  for the use of transferring and printing your pictures  they re simple and serve their purpose  there s nothing extra here to titillate  so if you want something advanced  you re on your own   transfer    the file transfer via the usb cable is quick and painless  taking no more than a minute for the full 8 mb memory card  the pictures are in the common jpeg format  so you ll be able to view and edit them in any photo editing program  when you connect the camera to your computer and turn it on  hehe  the  finepix viewer  program will automatically launch to transfer and display your photos  you can then save or delete at your choosing   memory    the included 8 megabyte memory card may not seem enough for those who like to take high resolution pictures  but the great thing about digital cameras is that they re film less  once you ve transferred the pictures to your computer  you can erase the card and use it again  if you prefer to take more than a couple of pictures at a time  i d recommend an upgrade to a 32 mb or 64 mb memory card  take note that the fuji finepix a101 only uses  smartmedia  memory cards i extras    if you re looking for more  the   fuji finepix a101   can also be used a pc webcam as mentioned earlier  this is especially useful for those who like to broadcast their lives online or videoconference    151 it s not exactly perfect  151  i battery life    the problem with digital cameras is that they tend to drain batteries  especially if you frequently use the lcd display  i ve probably used up about  30 worth of batteries to take less than a hundred pictures with the   fuji finepix a101    i just wasn t smart enough to get rechargeable ones  so the lesson here  don t be stupid like me and get rechargeable batteries  but don t forget the charger   durability    the camera has a light plastic body  which makes it at risk for breaking in the event you drop it or bang it against something  unfortunately  it doesn t come with a carrying case to protect it  so it s a good idea to get one b 151 i m almost done  151  to bring this review to a conclusion  i d recommend the   fuji finepix a101   digital camera to soccer moms and dads  partygoers  novices  students  freaks and geeks  the young and old   anyone who likes to take everyday pictures  don t expect to get the latest  biggest  baddest technological gadget   because this is not one  it s been out in stores for a while now  but it s still a nice camera that will suit all your basic needs and compete with the rest of them  thanks for reading november rain b 151 sample photos  151  florida  disneyworld s epcot center  http image1ex

328,camera, it s without doubt the best digital camera i ever had or tested in this price range  it couldn t get better  the optical zoom makes it better then most digital cameras  the bonus is that it can record a sequence of film and sound  not so useful but fun if you don t want to bring a dv camera to a party or event  it looks and feels and operates like a  quot real quot  camera  it also has a  quot macro lens quot  useful when you want to take a picture of a small thing like a butterfly  like all other digital cameras the only thing you have to think about is that if you take a close up you should use the display to focus since you don t look through the lens  the camera is comfortable to hold and doesn t weigh much  i have dropped mine a few times without anything happening to it  the look and feel is great and the pictures are even better  it s worth all the extra money it costs  it s so much better than all other digital cameras that aren t professional  you can t get a better camera for the same price br br  ,without doubt best digital camera ever test price range get better optical room make better digital camera bonus record sequence film sound useful fun want bring camera party event look feel operate like quit real quit camera also quit micro lens quit useful want take picture small thing like butterfly like digital camera thing think take close use display focus since look lens camera comfortable hold weigh much drop mine time without anything happen look feel great picture even better worth extra money cost much better digital camera professional get better camera price br
329,camera, well i am parshall to this camera because i own one  for people who do not need to take movie clips and who are novices at digital photography then this is the camera for them  sony doesn t skimp you on anything for the cheapo price  unfortunently i paid  499 for mine instead of the listed price they have on this site  in fact everywhere i have seen them they have been priced  499  the thing that caught my attention on this camera is that it has a 3 1 2 floppy drive built in to the camera  instead of the flash slots in other digital cameras  this means when the disk is full you just pop it out and pop in another one  instead of finding a computer to download the pictures on from the flash card  it has a lcd screen on the back along with many other functions such as picture effect like black and white  negative art  and sepia which looks like the old western pictures  other functions include flash options  10x zoom  and what type of file you want to save the picture in  another thing i love about this camera is that it allows you to see the picture you just took and if you don t like it you can delete it right then and there so it doesn t take up space  some of its downfalls though is that it s a little bulky and the weight is moderate  it also has auto focus so you don t have to worry about the clarity of the pictures  when the battery is dead it only takes about an hour to recharge to full capacity  over all i give it a 4 out of 5 br br  ,well marshall camera one people need take movie clip novices digital photography camera sonya skin anything cheap price unfortunently pay mine instead list price site fact everywhere see price thing catch attention camera floppy drive build camera instead flash shots digital camera mean disk full pop pop another one instead find computer download picture flash card lead screen back along many function picture effect like black white negative art septa look like old western picture function include flash option room type file want save picture another thing love camera allow see picture take like delete right take space downfall though little bulky weight moderate also auto focus worry clarity picture battery dead take hour charge full capacity give br
330,camera, the canon elph s230 is a small  solid point shoot digital camera that is for you if you re looking to take photos without any hassle  it s the first camera in that size from canon to sport a 3 2 megapixel ccd  enough to print reasonable quality 8x10 prints on a photo quality inkjet printer at 2400 dpi it sports a 2x optical zoom  never pay attention to the digital zoom it just makes your photos look really grainy  and has an advanced aiaf auto focusing system  this just means that your photos look sharp and always in focus if you take them when there is plenty of sunlight  this system does a much better job than anything canon or any other digital camera manufacturer has released to date because of its simple design  the manual controls on the camera are limited  you can set a couple different flash modes  on off red eye night time  the shutter speed  and the light sensitivity setting  iso 100 400  but beyond that  the lens is always in automatic mode  you can t set the aperature  nor can you tinker with other settings that can give you full control of the shot   thus  you can t play around with depth of field or do anything else artistic if you re looking to do some serious amateur photography  one additional gripe  because the lens element is so small  low light or indoor photos are really blurry and grainy  more so than other digital cameras  the flash is also somewhat weak  if you re 3 feet away from the person you ll be able to see him clearly but anything beyond that gets really dark and fuzzy ok  enough of the techno talk onto looking at the user experience  some thoughts 1  the camera is really easy to use  and the controls are rather intuitive  the setting buttons are small and sometimes hard to press  but then again  the camera is small i m not one to complain 2  changing photo options often requires that you go into a menu system  while it works  i prefer a camera where i can press a button to access that particular option rather than having to navigate through a couple of menus 3  taking a photo is a snap  just point  shoot  and the camera does the rest  the aiaf feature and other intelligent controls help figure out all the details  focus  matrixing  etc  for you so you don t have to deal with that 4  the photos come out really nice  it s comparable to larger  more expensive digital cameras  except  as i mentioned previously  in low light or indoor conditions where the small lens element makes the photos a bit more fuzzy than it otherwise needs to be in any case  i m happy with the camera  the best thing about it is it s extremely portable  just slip it in your pocket and you won t feel a thing  ,canon small solid point shoot digital camera look take photo without haste first camera size canon sport megapixel cod enough print reasonable quality print photo quality inject printer dip sport optical room never pay attention digital room make photo look really grain advance auto rouse system mean photo look sharp always focus take plenty sunlight system much better job anything canon digital camera manufacturer release date simple design manual control camera limit set couple different flash modes red eye night time shutter speed light sensitivity set iso beyond lens always automatic mode set aperture tinker settings give full control shoot thus play around depth field anything else artistic look serious amateur photography one additional grip lens element small low light indoor photo really flurry grain digital camera flash also somewhat weak feet away person able see clearly anything beyond get really dark fully ok enough teno talk onto look user experience thoughts camera really easy use control rather intuition set button small sometimes hard press camera small one complain change photo option often require go menu system work prefer camera press button access particular option rather navigable couple venus take photo snap point shoot camera rest feature intelligent control help figure detail focus matrixing etc deal photo come really nice comparable larger expensive digital camera except mention previously low light indoor condition small lens element make photo bite fully otherwise need case happy camera best thing extremely portable slip pocket feel thing

333,camera, intro  cameras suffer from the problem of  moores law  which essentially mean that they are advancing quickly and every few years or so  your camera will go into obsolecense  which is why  like with my computer purchases  i go with the standard  1 rule  i buy what is currently the standard in quality performance  but one step up  usually this has treated me better than trying to buy cutting bleeding edge technology which cameras suffer greatly from initial right off i was happy  it takes great 4 0 megapixel pictures in automatic mode  has a handy little folding lcd which i thought would be useless  but is actually pretty awesome for self portraits and other interesting shots  still life  the camera uses aa batteries which  though more practical if you travel  can be annoying in regards to battery life  the zoom is 3x and had a digital zoom  which i will probably never use  i haven t used all the features yet  since i have had the camera for only a few weeks  using it the quality is great  and the prints that turn out also  the color is usually right on  except in low light situations  the 3x zoom doesn t allow for much flexibility  i haven t tried the digital zoom  the camera is very feature rich  and i am already enjoying shooting in manual mode  you can control the aperture and speed with the very ergonomic controls  and even the flash power can be set which i enjoyed  the software that came with the camera is actually pretty good  though you cant do much in the way of editing  32mb card that is provided is barely adequate for much  but it s nice to have as an extra  i bought a 256mb card  and it s fine for our needs  the batteries don t last long naturally  especially with using the flash  so rechargables are a must  it would have been nice if the camera came with the ac adapter  so at least you aren t killing the batteries when you are downloading pictures to the computer  speed is pretty good  i like the autofocus  the viewfinder is also nice  and zooms when you zoom the small lcd is both a con and a pro  it saves battery life  but it s also hard to tell whether a shot is good or not  ,camera suffer problem moore law essentially mean advance quickly every years camera go obsolecense like computer purchase go standard rule buy currently standard quality performance one step usually treat better try buy cut bleed edge technology camera suffer greatly initial right happy take great megapixel picture automatic mode handy little fold lead think would useless actually pretty awesome self portraits interest shots still life camera use batteries though practical travel annoy regard battery life room digital room probably never use use feature yet since camera weeks use quality great print turn also color usually right except low light situations room allow much flexibility try digital room camera feature rich already enjoy shoot manual mode control aperture speed economic control even flash power set enjoy software come camera actually pretty good though much way edit mb card provide barely adequate much nice extra buy mb card fine need batteries last long naturally especially use flash rechargables must would nice camera come ac adapt least kill batteries download picture computer speed pretty good like autofocus viewfinder also nice room room small lead con pro save battery life also hard tell whether shoot good

rest of us  with parents scattered all over the states and the globe  staying in touch with them becomes more and more urgent especially when the grandkids start asking questions about grandpa and grandma  digital photography has come to shorten that great distance  extended families can remain abreast of their loved ones  news and progress   minolta f100 zoom digital camera  is the right camera that can help family members to bond once again  with the popularity of e mail and customized web albums  this camera is the right addition to the family s set of equipment  in my interaction

this camera b well  if you are looking for superior performance and style  then you d better go with the best on the market  there again  it s all relative to your needs  if you are only a beginner  obviously your needs will be drastically different from those of a professional or an intermediate user  they may need to get some specific results  don t let the preceding statements fool you when it comes to which cameras to use to e mail pictures to your loved ones or post them on your sites  all digital cameras can meet this basic need  the minolta dimage f100 comes loaded with 4 megapixels  for sure  your pictures will have a higher resolution  keep in mind that the higher the resolution  the more megapixels are in use  the sharper the image will be when blown up to larger and larger sizes  when we are talking about low resolution  we mostly see cameras with less than a megapixel  don t fall into that trap  buy a camera you can be proud of for some time  the minolta dimage f100 is

market right now  it has a storage capacity of 16 mb  it s already a given that this camera has a very high resolution  a very important feature that all buyers should care about is the difference between   optical and digital zoom    it all comes down to the optical zoom being the better of the two due to the fact that in a camera such the minolta dimage f100 or any other one is like zooming in a film camera  when you zoom  the image quality or resolution of the object is preserved  the dimage f100 uses 3x optical zoom 2 5x digital zoom and movie mode with sound  it s a combination of the

338,camera, every so often a product pops up that sets the standard for its time  in camcorders  it was sony s trv900  still manufactured and still highly sought after  and for digital cameras the canon g1 g2 cameras have garnered the same kind of devotion from their owners and kudos from reviewers  that s one nice thing you ll certainly discover as you research this camera  and at almost  800 dollars  i m certain you re doing plenty of research  there are hundreds of owners  reviews and samples from the g2 to be found on the net  as g2 owner  i m happy to throw my own support behind the camera  surf  research  compare   i did  and three weeks down the road i decided the g2 was the camera to buy your first 2 stops on the web researching the camera will probably be phil askey s review at the digital photography website www dpreview com reviews canong2  this is a very detailed review and worth referring back to again and again  but let me sum it up for you  phil considers the canon g2  as of summer 2002   the benchmark  in consumer digital cameras  now you can spend more than  2 000 dollars and get better  but for the average person the g2 s price is already asking a lot  so phil s calling the g2 a  benchmark  is completely fair at this price point  simply put  he gives it the  highly recommended  rating it deserves your next stop will probably be steve s digicams   www steves digicams com 2001 reviews g2 html  while steve s reviews aren t quite as intensive and his summaries not as informative  a bit of a balancing act neither here nor there  the site is of great interest if you agree that  seeing is believing  when choosing a camera  steve s photo samples spelled it out very clearly to me and led me to pick the g2 because of its samples  the g2 takes wonderfully detailed  sharp  yet expressive photos you may wonder why i say  sharp  yet expressive  photos  having worked for 12 years as a professional photographer you get to know the  character  of different lenses  nikon lenses  for example are remarkable sharp but also  flat  in that they add little atmospherics to a photograph  i always felt portraits looked rather cold through a nikon lens  a perfect example of a  nikon shot  would be a sports photo   sharp  focused but a little clinical  many great photographers swear by leica camera  and their lenses are what i consider  expressive  they are also focused and clear  but they also lend an gorgeous touch of  romance  or photographic  timelessness  to a picture  look at the work of the world s great photographers and you ll see what i mean  unfortunately lecias rangefinders are expensive cameras and take time to operate to perfection   not for novices  now  in my experience   which has included nikon  olympus  pentax  canon and leica  i found that canon lenses are a happy medium  offering both the clarity of nikon lenses  but a touch of that  classic look  magic  that was another reason i became so enamoured of the g2  it has the wonderful canon lens look  and unlike many other cameras  canon manufactures the lens for the g2 itself  if you want to take family portraits or give photojournalism a try  the g2 s optics will serve you wonderfully techically  it s a brillant piece of work  not it s not as responsive as an slr  but when you add autofocus and exposure things always tend to lag a bit  and the fact that the g2 is a pocket camera  more or less  it certainly isn t the handful a full sized slr presents  lets you accept this  lag time  shortcoming for the wonderful job it does thinking for you  on the practical side  its lithium ion battery is a lifesaver  it s the same battery used in canon d30  2 400  camera  if you ve pondered the question which is better   using aa batteries or a proprietry battery   the answer is lithium batteries charge fast  last forever and don t suffer from any memory effects  i ve shot 40 50 photos a day for 3 days straight and haven t put a dent in my battery  you can carry this on an extended weekend trip and leave the charger at home  it s a fantasic power system  and leaves regular batteries in the dust okay  but why should i spend almost  800 on a camera  well  if you re a  350 a week man with a family and no saving  don t  if you think you can afford it  you ll find your old love  or a new love  for taking photographs blossoming  film developing and printing costs are a thing of the past  if you have a computer and a printer  which i trust you do if you re considering a digicam  and you can shoot  shoot  shoot without worrying about running out of exposures  and erasing what you don t like along the way  i recently was talking with time magazine photographer and gushing over a photo essay he did in the salt fields of india  i asked him what kind of photo paper he printed on in the darkroom and he said   i havent  been in the darkroom in three years  i do them on my computer and with an epson printer  that s when i began looking for my digital camera the downside well  as i ve said  i m finicky and i ve found i m only happy with photos printed at 300dpi  on 4 megabite cameras that allow me a size up to about 5 5 x7 75  inches  which make for nice display around the home  but precludes really taking gallery sized photos  some people say they have gotten great 8x10 or 11x14s from the camera  i just don t see it happening  or at least not to my eye also  my only non  5  rating for the camera has to do with construction   800 is a steep price for a camera and expecting all metal construction would not have been out of line at this price point  minus one for its body  in other words  don t drop it  of course i never dropped one in all my years shooting  so don t fret it  just remember  its a camera   they re fragile on final point  this camera is not a wysiwyg through the viewfinder slr  you can compose your photo using the camera s lcd screen  absolutely fine to use  but if you re an old photo buff and insist on looking through the viewfinder  which i do  you ll definitely miss there not being any exposure  speed  etc  information displayed there  that information is only available on the lcd screen  so to change your shutter speed or f stop  you ll have to use the lcd screen  this bugged me at first  but i learned to live with it fast  it s really not a problem the verdict i love the g2  it s a little photographic miracle  as is everything about digital photography  and i heartily recommend the camera  like i ve said  there s a big support group of happy owners out there who ll agree with me on

340,auto, this review is all about attitude  if you re looking to buy a lincoln mark vii you can get all the tech specs and cold  hard numbers you want on this car  but screw that what you really want to hear about is what this car is all about  attitude  baby the lincoln mark vii lsc makes no apologies for what it is  politically correct  minivan driving  starbucks swilling yuppies be damned this car thumbs its nose at everything held precious by today s soccer moms and dot com dads  it s a relic of reaganomics  a standing tall  shining city on a hill  all amurrican kind of vehicle  viewed from head on with its front wheels turned to a rakish angle  it looks you right in the eye and says   quot if you don t like it  then stick it up your tailpipe quot  and  like the outspoken governor of minnesota  it has the muscle to go with the attitude gawd  i love this car i ve loved this car since it first hit the streets in 1984  for the next few years i could only dream of owning one  but today i can look back and count four that i ve owned  including two currently  in its first two model years  the mark s makers put more emphasis on luxury and leather than sportiness  but beginning in 1986  with the lsc sport coupe leading the way  the mark vii found its groove with a pumped up 5 0 liter v8  same as the mustang gt  improved suspension and steering  dual exhaust  performance rear end  etc  etc  etc ford kept pouring on the power until the  quot vii quot  was replaced with the  quot viii quot  in 1993 and the end of an era for those of us who believe this to be the best looking luxury coupe ever produced  for the lead footed folks  the pinnacle of mark vii attitude was the se model  a sinister looking  nearly chrome free version of the lsc series  it came in black or red  but black was the color of choice for this brute in velvet gloves the mark vii was also a test bed for ford s leading technology of the eighties  as a result  the cockpit is chock full of buttons  lights  buzzers and chimes  the car rides on four air bags instead of coil springs and uses a unique german made anti lock brake system  features like these promote a love hate relationship with current owners who must get down in the technical trenches or shell out big bucks for repairs  most owners  however  would agree that the mark vii is very reliable   even when rolling through the second hundred thousand miles   but when things do break  they re expensive the upside to all this is that the cars are relatively cheap to buy  but if you do  consider the purchase price as a down payment and go into it knowing you will have to cough up more down the road  but don t let it scare you away  my marks have delivered many thousands of low cost miles to me over the years  besides  if you would actually consider buying a camry or some other faceless  econo clone man  you re in the wrong place so get behind the wheel of an lsc and hey  whaddayou lookin at     ,review attitude look buy lincoln mark vii get teach speck cold hard number want car screw really want hear car attitude baby lincoln mark vii make apologies politically correct midian drive starbucks swell supply damn car thumb nose everything hold precious today soccer moss dot com days relic reaganomics stand tall shin city hill american kind vehicle view head front wheel turn ravish angle look right eye say quit like stick tailpipe quit like outspoken governor minnesota muscle go attitude love car love car since first hit streets next years could dream own one today look back count four own include two currently first two model years mark makers put emphasis luxury leather shortness begin sport couple lead way mark vii find groove pump later improve suspension sneer dual exhaust performance rear end etc ford keep pour power quit vii quit replace quit viii quit end era us believe best look luxury couple ever produce lead loot folks pinnacle mark vii attitude se model sinister look nearly come free version series come black red black color choice brute velvet gloves mark vii also test bed ford lead technology eighties result cockpit clock full button light buyers chime car rid four air bag instead coil spring use unique german make anti lock brake system feature like promote love hate relationship current owners must get technical trench shell big buck repair owners however would agree mark vii reliable even roll second hundred thousand miles things break expensive upside cars relatively cheap buy consider purchase price payment go know cough road let scare away mark deliver many thousands low cost miles years besides would actually consider buy carry careless second alone man wrong place get behind wheel hey whaddayou look
341,auto, well the 222 horsepower maxima raises another question  how much hp can you shove in to an ugly exterior  quite a few as it turns out  anyway  i personally dont like the exterior body design  it is practically the same as the years before with the exception of the slightly modified rear lights  the interior is quite nice with the full leather interior option  but what car isn t nice with full interior  forgive me for not liking this car  by all means its a good car as far as speed and luxury combined  but still not good enough to live up to its 26k loaded sticker price tag  however they managed to put 22 more horsepower in to that small v6 engine and still get 25mpg which i am quite impressed with seeing as how gas prices seem to keep going up  anyway my overall verdict is solid car  very nice interior  good enough speed  but ugly body design and lack of thought for the body design br br  ,well horsepower maxim raise another question much shove ugly exterior quite turn anyway personally dont like exterior body design practically years exception slightly modify rear light interior quite nice full leather interior option car nice full interior forgive like car mean good car far speed luxury combine still good enough live load stick price tag however manage put horsepower small engine still get pg quite impress see gas price seem keep go anyway overall verdict solid car nice interior good enough speed ugly body design lack think body design br
342,auto, i looked at several vehicles before making the decision to get out of my nissan lease early  thank the powers above i looked at the saturn ls  dodge stratus  and all of the hondas  i decided on the cougar for several reasons back in november of 1999  my fiancee was looking at a new car  in maxim  they had a picture of all of the 2000s  and the cougar stood out on the page  she thought it was not practical enough for her  so she got a civic  nice car this past month  i went car shopping and the cougar was the last car i looked at  the stratus was close  but i decided to take the cougar considering it was less money and my fiancee had a 4 door car  being only in the second week  i made the right choice first off  the mercury dealer was the most honest  the dodge dealers were kind of shady  and the saturn did not allow me to haggle the price  although they did offer me some sort of money off  also  the mercury drove well and i just loved the little computer with all that information i got a fantastic deal on my car  it was fully loaded except for leather  sunroof  and cd changer  i paid just over  17 000 with all of these dealer incentives  i got the  quot laser red quot  color the car is a headturner  people stair at my car  it looks a lot more expensive than the price  with the wide tires and cool rims  people are always gazing at the car  the front with the sleek hood design and the rear with the spoiler and shaped tail are freaking cool  plus  the side designs are narly as well ok  so as you can tell  i love this car  the only real negative with this car is the small back seat  while the bucket seats in the back look nice  there are not too many people that can sit back there  also  the radio could be a little more user friendly i would tell everyone that is looking for a reasonably priced sports car to jump on this cat  it is well worth the price   ,look several vehicles make decision get nissan lease early thank power look return dodge status hand decide sugar several reason back november fiancee look new car maxim picture sugar stand page think practical enough get civic nice car past month go car shop sugar last car look status close decide take sugar consider less money fiancee door car second week make right choice first mercury dealer honest dodge dealers kind shady return allow angle price although offer sort money also mercury drive well love little computer information get fantastic deal car fully load except leather sunroof change pay dealer incentive get quit laser red quit color car headturner people stair car look lot expensive price wide tire cool aim people always gaze car front sleek hood design rear spoil shape tail break cool plus side design early well ok tell love car real negative car small back seat bucket seat back look nice many people sit back also radio could little user friendly would tell everyone look reasonably price sport car jump cat well worth price

344,camera, o k  here is the deal  i have two cameras  the  150 umax astracam 1800  1 3mp  and the  500 ricoh rdc 7  3 2 mp  both cameras are not mainstream  but cool if you taker a closer look  they are both small and give good pictures  here is why i like the umax 1800  it is the one camera that is easily available to take spur of the moment shots  it powers on very quickly  less than 2 sec  and the total time from power on to  picture taken  is  timed  3 5 4 seconds  since the camera is very plain  no additional settings need to be taken care of  and yet it takes great pictures over a wide variety of conditions  definitely more fun than a film based camera  especially in low light  also  it runs off only two aa s  the lack of a preview lcd screen is not too bad  it saves energy  camera lasts very long on nimh s  and it also saves time  so when it comes to taking a quick snap  the umax 1800 is often my preferred camera  i use the ricoh when i have more time and want better pictures and control  but the ricoh takes a long time to capture the shot  ricoh rdc 7  take out of protective carrying case  it s expensive  so i keep it in there  take off lens cap  longer power on due to zoom   af lens  open up fold away lcd  align camera so desired picture appears on lcd  then shoot  longer delay b c of af  also  the many controls entice you to  optimize  exposure etc  before the shot  taking away even more time  umax 1800  power on  glance through optical viewfinder  shoot  get decent pictures on almost any occasion  so  in light of the recent appreciation that i discovered for my cheap umax 1800  i decided to give it a positive review  it s better than you might think  i definitely wouldn t want to miss it  other reviews  http www pcworld com reviews article asp aid 18905 http www neoseeker com hardware products umax astracam1800 i once posted a few nice shots  great twilight capability  but i can t find them online anymore  lost in the web  ,deal two camera max astraea rich rd camera mainstream cool take closer look small give good picture like max one camera easily available take spur moment shots power quickly less see total time power picture take time second since camera plain additional settings need take care yet take great picture wide variety condition definitely fun film base camera especially low light also run two lack review lead screen bad save energy camera last long nigh also save time come take quick snap max often prefer camera use rich time want better picture control rich take long time capture shoot rich rd take protective carry case expensive keep take lens cap longer power due room lens open fold away lead align camera desire picture appear lead shoot longer delay also many control entice optimism exposure etc shoot take away even time max power glance optical viewfinder shoot get decent picture almost occasion light recent appreciation discover cheap max decide give positive review better might think definitely want miss review http www world com review article asp aid http www neoseeker com hardware products max astraea post nice shots great twilight capability find online anymore lose web

346,auto, well  not a whole lot  to be honest  i ve always driven trucks or suv s  and i was very reluctant about buying a car  you see  i m very short  this may sound unrelated  but i m just over 5 feet tall  and i never really liked the idea of being so close to the ground while i drove  whenever i was forced to drive a car when my car was in the shop or being used by someone else  i always felt like i was driving a go cart so  when i recently decided to trade in my explorer for something more fuel efficient  i figured i d stay with ford and go for a taurus  i purchased the taurus les  the luxury model  complete with leather interior and climate control  and i have to tell you  it s been absolutely incredible  apparently  ford has been working on the new design for the taurus for somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 years  although i m still closer to the ground than i d like  this model is much better than my mother s 1996 taurus  the car rides much smoother than my explorer ever did  and it s much more fuel efficient  so  if there is anyone out there who s been hit as hard by the gas price hike and is nervous about buying a car  i d highly recommend this beautiful  economical car     ,well whole lot honest always drive trunks sun reluctant buy car see short may sound unrelated feet tall never really like idea close grind drive whenever force drive car car shop use someone else always felt like drive go cart recently decide trade explorer something fuel efficient figure stay ford go turn purchase turn les luxury model complete leather interior climate control tell absolutely incredible apparently ford work new design turn somewhere neighborhood years although still closer grind like model much better mother turn car rid much smoother explorer ever much fuel efficient anyone hit hard gas price like nervous buy car highly recommend beautiful economical car
347,camera, i bought a fuji finepix 1300 some four months back  thought of sharing my views and experience with the same let me talk about the pros first  fuji is my first digital camera and i found it very easy to use it  the buttons and knobs for various controls are designed perfectly  without reading the manual itself  we can start operating the camera size is really good and it can be kept inside our shirt pocket  so carrying and handling it is really simple the picture quality is good  that much only can be expected from a 1 3 mega pixel camera  the usb is really good and is very fast  i could download my pictures in 10 seconds time  the software that comes with the camera is good and easy to use now let me come to the cons  battery   4 numbers are required  the camera is very hungry always and eats my battery power like anything  so without rechargeable batteries we cannot feed the camera  lcd is very small and is dull  the picture quality in the computer screen and the one in the camera screen are very much different in terms of quality  compatibility with various operating systems  i had to struggle with my computer to install the usb driver  it will not work in many old win versions and few latest too  so buyers be careful about this point let me conclude by telling that  this camera is a good choice for a starter whose main use of digital pictures is to put in web pages or sending them to their loved ones say cheese   ,buy full finepix four months back think share view experience let talk pro first full first digital camera find easy use button knobs various control design perfectly without read manual start operate camera size really good keep inside shirt pocket carry handle really simple picture quality good much expect meg fix camera us really good fast could download picture second time software come camera good easy use let come sons battery number require camera hungry always eat battery power like anything without rechargeable batteries fee camera lead small dull picture quality computer screen one camera screen much different term quality incompatibility various operate systems struggle computer install us driver work many old win versions latest buyers careful point let conclude tell camera good choice start whose main use digital picture put web page send love ones say cheese
348,camera, overview i originally bought this camera as a  portable  addition to my nikon slr camera  instead  i have purchased a complete replacement to the much bigger nikon slr  i bought this camera from amazon com in 11 2001 for  399 with free shipping and a rebate that included a sling bag  a 16mb cf card  and an extra battery in addition to the standard camera package of course  the camera takes excellent pictures both indoor and outdoors  but  the main feature of this camera is it s great size  this camera is so small that i take it everywhere  and i don t look like a nerd doing so  i think that i actually look sort of cool  since upgrading from my slr  i ve been able to capture so much more of my adventures on film the camera supports the main features that i was interested in  black   white photos  hi resolution color photos  2 1mpix is perfectly suitable for 8 10 prints  movies with sound  great software  etc connection to the computer before buying digital  i was concerned that the interface between my canon and the computer would quickly become obsolete  this  however is not the case  any computer  running any version of windows with usb will be able to support this camera  if usb becomes obsolete  then you ll merely have to purchase a compact flash card reader that connects to the computer via another interface like firewire  software the software bundled with this camera is pretty good  installation was easy  downloading photos and movies onto the computer is very  very easy  organizing the photos on my computer  keep in mind that you ll soon have hundreds or even thousands of pictures to manage  is easy  they supply software that will allow you to digitally enhance your photos or movies  they also supply an interesting piece of software called photostitch i wish that the camera shipped with adobe photoshop  but that program alone probably costs  500 700  photostitch software allows you to digitally combine multiple images to form one giant  panoramic  perhaps  image  i took a series of about 9 beautiful pictures of this coastal town and digitally  stitched  them together using this software  the picture looks amazing  the camera also supports panoramic shots through one of its shooting modes  when used with photostitch  the results are fantastic memory the camera ships with a wimpy 8mb cf card  while this is suitable to get up and running with the camera  i d recommend immediately buying the most memory that you can afford  the camera supports any size type i compact flash card  i recently bought a 256mb cf card and have had superior results  i can store approximately 260 of the highest quality images  or literally thousands of lower quality images keep in mind that a top quality 2 1 mpixel image takes about 1mb worth of memory  if you use a higher mpixel camera  you ll need more memory  luckily  memory prices are dropping fast  so we ll all soon be able to take as many pictures as we want movies the movies have turned out to be a very  very fun addition to this camera  regardless of the size of the cf card  the s110 only allows you to take 5 7second  highest res  15 sec  medium res  or 30 second  low resolution  movies  it s really been a blast taking both black and white  and color movies  unlike some cameras  the movies do have sound  the sound is pretty good  when viewed on the computer  the movies look great  when viewed directly on the tv through the supplied video cable the movies look a little choppy  presumably because of their large size tv connection saying that  it s been fun hooking the s110 up to the tv  just plug the camera into the cable and you can have a slideshow on any tv  this has been fun as i rent a ski house with a bunch of people  at the end of the weekends we plug in the camera and run through the pictures  battery life the battery comes with a rapid charger  use the battery for about 150 170 shots with the flash and it ll be totally depleted  note that these high quality batteries do not need to be fully drained before recharging them  i got the rebate offer for a free battery   but i only sent in the form about 3 weeks ago so hopefully i ll see another battery soon  other niceties the camera will take pictures using a timer  press the trigger and wait for about 10 seconds before the picture is taken  i also bought a nice  very inexpensive  5  tripod that screws into the tripod holder  the tripod has three flexible 5  legs  the legs are flexible  and thus the camera can be mounted anywhere  when you are done with the tripod simply straighten out the legs  unscrew the tripod  and put the tripod in your pocket  ,overview originally buy camera portable addition union sir camera instead purchase complete replacement much bigger

351,auto, okay  my car isn t a 99  it s a 96  the reason i am posting  though  is that i feel my opinion is valuable since i have been driving this car for a long time  i can be a good judge on how reliable it is our family is not the type to trade a car off every two years  we drive a car until the wheels fall off or the motor blows up  in the ten years we have been married  my husband and i have only bought one new car a 1996 chevy geo metro  it is a white four door  it has a low sloped front end and a high seated rear end  making the car resemble an egg  hence the nickname  quot egg mobile quot  the car has changed very little since 1996  except chevrolet has dropped the  quot geo quot  line  this car has been very dependable  we rely on this little car everyday as the family car and work car  for years my husband drove it about  50 miles one way to work  we have taken it on many long trips  it has never  knock on wood  given us any problems  we have never had the car in the shop for anything besides routine maintanince  oil changes  tires  breaks  ect  it starts everytime we turn the key  and it gets us where we want to go  no muss  no fuss  thank you very much the car is a geo  and it has a little engine  this is great for gas millage  and bad for power  my 1988 toyota tercel has alot more power  and it has engine problems  but  turn off the air conditioner  put the pedal to the floor  and the car will pass in good time the other complaint i have about this car is that it has a small back window and a high trunk  which makes it difficult to judge distance while passing or driving in reverse  it also only seats four  this is good when you are a family of four  but bad when you want to take nana along for the ride this car will be paid off later this year  we plan on trading in the tercel for a larger car  my husband plans on giving me the new car and keeping the geo to drive to work  he has always claimed the newer car  but this time i think he s attatched  you know how men are about their cars br br  ,okay car reason post though feel opinion valuable since drive car long time good judge reliable family type trade car every two years drive car wheel fall motor blow ten years marry husband buy one new car go retro white four door low slope front end high seat rear end make car resemble egg hence nickname quit egg mobile quit car change little since except chevrolet drop quit go quit line car dependable rely little car everyday family car work car years husband drive miles one way work take many long trip never knock wood give us problems never car shop anything besides routine maintenance oil change tire break act start everytime turn key get us want go muss fuss thank much car go little engine great gas village bad power tooth term clot power engine problems turn air condition put pedal floor car pass good time complaint car small back window high trunk make difficult judge distance pass drive reverse also seat four good family four bad want take anna along ride car pay later year plan trade term larger car husband plan give new car keep go drive work always claim newer car time think attach know men cars br

353,camera, i bought this camera so that i could put pictures on the internet for auctions  etc  i also liked the idea of being able to do inexpensive projects with the kids posters  pictures for family members etc we only paid  99 00 plus shipping through aol and it did come pretty quick  no complaints there the camera serves it s purpose  for the time being  but if i could go back i would probably wait until i could afford a better one  it s ok for a first camera and it is good for enough for most of what i use it for but it s hard to get good close ups from it and it doesn t hold much in the memory  although you can purchase additional cards it s been a really neat toy for us though i love being able to share pictures online with family and friends just the technology of it all is exciting to us still it s also good for making sales flyers if you have something to sell in your community  a sofa for instance  just put the photo on regular copy paper and add your info after all is said and done  i would say to look carefully and investigate your options before putting your money into it  if you are looking for a first digital camera for sharing photos with family and such it s not a bad camera for the basics i do like the idea of being able to get the pictures right away and not have to pay for the developing too  so it really was worth it to us in the long run  but still i wish i d waited  but hey  life is still good br br  ,buy camera could put picture internet auction etc also like idea able expensive project kiss posters picture family members etc pay plus ship come pretty quick complaints camera serve purpose time could go back would probably wait could afford better one ok first camera good enough use hard get good close hold much memory although purchase additional card really neat toy us though love able share picture online family friends technology excite us still also good make sales ulcers something sell community sofa instance put photo regular copy paper add say do would say look carefully investigate option put money look first digital camera share photo family bad camera basis like idea able get picture right away pay develop really worth us long run still wish wait hey life still good br

355,camera, i have been wanting a digital camera ever since they first came out but  i just can t afford one just yet  so  when my daughter graduated this year i borrowed a friends sony mavica 88  now i know for sure what camera i am saving up for  this was extremely easy to operate  it has a big enough screen for viewing that it makes it easy to capture just the shot you want  the 16 times zoom is awesome  we were sitting way in the back of the auditorium and the pictures looked like we were right up front  it also takes beautiful indoors pictures  with a built in flash  the only problems i had was holding my hands steady enough that the items i was trying to photo didn t come out blurred  it takes a little practice to get used to how to push the button without moving the camera  it takes standard high density floppy disks which is real convenient as you don t have to plug the camera into your computer or have special software just for the camera  it depends on how you set up the camera as to how many pictures you can get on a disk  i kept it on the standard setting and got 7 pictures on a disk  this is another draw back to this type of camera  if you are going to be taking a lot of pictures you will need a lot of disks  when i did the pictures on the computer i was very pleased with how they turned out  i purchased the hp photo ink cartridge and some photo paper and you would never know that they weren t professionally done  this camera also comes with two batteries and a recharger  each battery lasts about 1 1 2 hours  all in all this is a great camera  i can t wait until i get one of my own br br  ,want digital camera ever since first come afford one yet daughter graduate year borrow friends sonya mavra know sure camera save extremely easy operate big enough screen view make easy capture shoot want time room awesome sit way back auditoriums picture look like right front also take beautiful indoors picture build flash problems hold hand steady enough items try photo come blur take little practice get use push button without move camera take standard high density floppy disk real convenient plug camera computer special software camera depend set camera many picture get disk keep standard set get picture disk another draw back type camera go take lot picture need lot disk picture computer please turn purchase photo ink cartridge photo paper would never know professionally do camera also come two batteries recharger battery last hours great camera wait get one br

out on the ability to have a continual long clip red eye  is common on normal flash mode  does have a flash setting to reduce red eye  this also can be fixed with image editing software on pc as all digital cameras  very limited  internal  memory  8mb  plan for 8 higher quality pics or about 24 medium quality pics with internal memory  better yet  plan to buy an sd memory card  which expands the memory picture storage  count on one picture per mb of memory for high quality pictures  i bought a 256mb and that has been fine  prices are coming down on the memory cards  i bought mine on ebay for about  60  but i ve recently been seeing them retail  with rebate  for same at various computer stores  you will also need a memory card  reader  to allow your pc to  read  the files off the card  i actually got several card  readers   dazzle  for free during one of officemax s recent sales no manual focus  for those pesky times when the autofocus can t get the focal distance right  i ve had some

battery  i got 12  but now realize that 4 is probably enough  but 6 to 8 batteries would be plenty  now i can get 250 to 500 pictures per pair of aas i install small lcd display no picture editing within camera  this is actually no problem at all for me  i beleive in taking as many pictures as possible  no deleting by me  let alone any on camera editing of images  i dump all the pics off the

359,camera, 1  why did i buy it this is my first digital camera  i bought it because i need it for my summer vacation  and i need one with great image quality so the pictures can last a life time 2  how do i know about the dsc p72 at first i did some research online try to find the perfect camera for me because i know nothing about digital camera  looking in to the price  performance  quality  and brand i finally found the one for me  sony cybershot dsc p72 3  sony cybershot dsc p71 dsc p72 a lot of people wonder what s the different between the dsc p71 and dsc p72  basically  the p72 is a newer model of the p71  the p72 fixed some of the problems in the p71 and overall improved the performance  so  if you re thinking of buying the dsc p71  you might want to check out the p72 4  the image quality the sony dsc p72 has a resolution of 3 2 mega pixels  which is more than enough for casual use  the p72 has 5 modes to choose from when taking pictures  the bigger the number mean the bigger the picture and higher quality  you can switch the mode anytime 3 1m xl 2 8m l 2 0m m 1 2m s vga 640x480 i use vga and 2 0m most of the time  because i like to post my pictures on the internet  3 1m is the best quality and the biggest size of them all  but the size of the file is too big  so it s not a good choice to use 3 1m if you want to upload the images to the net  just take pictures in all the modes and find the perfect one for your needs 5  the movie mode the dsc p72 allows you to record short video with sound  the length of the movie depends on the size of your memory stick  the memory stick included with this camera is 16mb which can record movie up the 20 seconds with sound  i like this movie mode a lot  its fun to capture video sometime  and the video and sound quality is very good  6  the lcd screen the size of the lcd screen is 1 5 inch same as most of the digital camera in the market right now  the screen is very clear  you can even change the brightness and contrast after you took pictures or recorded a video you can go to the playback mode and view your pictures video  you can put them in different folders  delete them and do whatever you want with them 7  ease of use you can operate this camera with one finger  everything can be set to automatic  and the camera will do the rest of the work for you  if you want more control  just press one button and set it to the way you like it  i use automatic on my entire picture collection  the quality  lighting and everything else is great 8  upload images to your pc wow super fast and easy  all you have to do is plug in the usb cable to your pc and the camera  and everything will be done automatically 9  bottom line the only problem i found is the battery life  but since sony gave us a rechargeable battery and a charger  that s not a big problem if you re looking for a digital camera with great image quality and easy to use  the dsc p72 is the one for you  you can not go wrong with this camera  it s just that good the package included 1 dsc p72 camera 2 rechargeable batteries 1 charger 1 16mb memory stick 1 cd thanks for reading my review  i hope this is helpful to some of you  ,buy first digital camera buy need summer vacation need one great image quality picture last life time know duc first research online try find perfect camera know nothing digital camera look price performance quality brand finally find one sonya cybershot duc sonya cybershot duc lot people wonder different duc duc basically newer model fix problems overall improve performance think buy duc might want check image quality sonya duc resolution meg pip enough casual use modes choose take picture bigger number mean bigger picture higher quality switch mode daytime va use va time like post picture internet best quality biggest size size file big good choice use want unload image net take picture modes find perfect one need movie mode duc allow record short video sound length movie depend size memory stick memory stick include camera mb record movie second sound like movie mode lot fun capture video sometime video sound quality good lead screen size lead screen inch digital camera market right screen clear even change brightness contrast take picture record video go playback mode view picture video put different holders delete whatever want ease use operate camera one finger everything set automatic camera rest work want control press one button set way like use automatic entire picture collection quality light everything else great unload image pp super fast easy plug us cable pp camera everything do automatically bottom line problem find battery life since sonya give us rechargeable battery charge big problem look digital camera great image quality easy use duc one go wrong camera good package include duc camera rechargeable batteries charge mb memory stick thank read review hope helpful
360,camera, i purchased this camera shortly after they came out  i had read reviews in the various magazines and was intrigued by the concept  i had a coupon at a web store and got it at a minimal price the camera is very small and easily fits into a shirt pocket  it uses one aaa battery and the battery life seems to be very good  it has a view finder  but no lcd to view the photos taken  probably due to the small size of the camera  that is not a problem   you sacrifice this for the small size  the package included a mounting device so you can use the camera as a webcam   i have not tried this the photos can be transferred to your pc using a special usb cable that is included in the package  this is a very easy process  i use a photo editor to  acquire  the images from the camera to the pc big disappointment in picture quality  the specs say it takes photos at 640x480 resolution  but the quality is very  very poor  the center of each photo is ok  but the outer one quarter on the top  bottom  and sides is out of focus  at first  i thought it was because i wasn t holding the camera still  but the out of focus areas still appeared even when bracing the camera against something solid  there is no flash  nor any means to add one  so indoor photos must use available lighting its too bad that the photo quality is so terrible  because this would be a nifty camera to own  it is probably the smallest camera on the market at about 2  x 2  you could have it with you wherever you go all in all  i cannot recommend this camera  ,purchase camera shortly come read review various magazines intrigue concept coupon web store get minimal price camera small easily fit shirt pocket use one ana battery battery life seem good view finder lead view photo take probably due small size camera problem sacrifice small size package include mount device use camera webcam try photo transfer pp use special us cable include package easy process use photo editor acquire image camera pp big disappointment picture quality speck say take photo resolution quality poor center photo ok outer one quarter top bottom side focus first think hold camera still focus areas still appear even race camera something solid flash mean add one indoor photo must use available light bad photo quality terrible would fifty camera probably smallest camera market could wherever go recommend camera
361,auto, before i get into the car details  you may question why i write this review  being a 16 year old avid car fan who drives his mother s car for transportation to work school etc  i may not know everything about this car  but for the 300 some odd miles i ve driven this car there has been alot of valuable things that i have learned  and right here is where i would like to share them with you i was 13 when my mom went to a toyota dealer and bought this off the lot  little did she know that 3 years later her  little boy  would be driving around in the same car by himself  yes i know its hard for me to even believe just yet  i m not exactly sure how much she spent for it  i would guess maybe around 12 14 000  if it is important to this review i will ask her myself so where shall we start  interior exterior interior exterior ok ok lets go with the interior interior not too much to say  everything basic  pwr everything  overdrive  a c  rear defrost  there is also a digital odometer and daytime running lights  something i haven t seen in other cars so this is maybe what separates it from those other cars  this car provides a good amount of room  unless you are a professional wrestler or shaq  you probably will not be fitting into this car  room in the back is good  room in the front however in the drivers side is a little different  i m pushing 6 1 and i have the seat all the way back  and the steering wheel moved all the way up  all these efforts still do not eliminate the problem of my left knee hitting the steering wheel  trunk space is quite good  i recall fitting 3 golf bags into the back  so if thats how you rate your trunk space then you re set  the system will not attract any attention really  yeah if you turn it up 80  you ll get some bumping out of it  but i m not very impressed  putting some subs in the back will easily eliminate this problem the exterior i m going to keep this short and simple  since it s late and i want to go to bed  this car will in no way turn heads  it is a simple 4 door design  nothing really seems to be too special about it  anything else you want to know about the exterior  too bad because there isn t anything else to know  if you spend maybe 2 thousand for some ground effects  put a spoiler on there  then we can talk under the hood not much can be said about it  it s an l 4 basic for this type of car  it has a 1 8l engine  like i said  basic for this kind of car  this can make the car pretty weak  i drive up the same uphill road every day  and every day im having to push the car just so i can maintain a steady 65 70mph highway speed  i find the acceleration to be all right  me being a person who loves to pour out of a turn coming off a red light  i can find that i can get up to 40 pretty quickly  and i find myself saying  hey  that ferrari 360 spyder was just behind me so where did it go  thats when my dreams get shattered and he s actually 3 miles ahead of me already  but hey  the pickup trucks and those honda s eat dust  the corolla redlines at 6000  so you can eliminate the drag racing up at race wars in the desert  the 4 cylinder smaller engine will make things better for you  if you hate gas guzzlers  then you know right now you ll be a bigger fan of this car  taking the thing to the mobil station for the first time  putting only 10 bucks in the tank and filling it up completely felt good  and if you liked that  you ll like the 30  mpg that this car gets the ride it provides a really smooth ride  i haven t really found anything wrong with the ride yet  but if i do  you know that i ll keep you informed     the brakes seem a little bit weak compared to my dad s mitsubishi galant or my stepdad s bmw 5 series  it s no huge problem to worry about  but when i go from driving the galant to driving the corolla  i can tell there is somewhat of a difference  nothing wrong with the handling  front engine front wheel drive  with new snow tires  i find minimal problems with the handling in the winter  minimal problems means the few times you ll slide on the ice when taking a turn  i had the misfortune of taking my road test in the biggest snowstorm all year  but i had no problems with anything  handling in regular weather is the same as it is for any car that i have driven  nothing horrible  but nothing great enough that i can tell how great it is this car will not turn heads  unless you have a half naked woman in the car or you have a 16 year old just getting his license who wants to drive and have his freedom  i do not think you will see a guy stepping into this car  if you want a car you can drive down the street and people look at you with the thought in their head of  wow that guy is lucky  then buy a new red trans am  preferably with ram air and a black racing stripe with tinted windows and 2  12 subs in the trunk  my dream car  but if you are looking for a car just to get from point a to point b  then you might want to definitely take the corolla into consideration  and the reliability speaks for itself  you put in the work the you will have a long lasting car  and yes we all know about toyota s reputation for that very long lasting car  if these are the few things you want in a car  then now you know what to buy p s  i had the tv going while i was typing this up  call it a coincidence  but right when i finished this review  a commercial for the new 2002 corolla just came on  ,get car detail may question write review year old aid car fan drive mother car transportation work school etc may know everything car odd miles drive car clot valuable things learn right would like share mon go tooth dealer buy lot little know years later little boy would drive around car yes know hard even believe yet exactly sure much spend would guess maybe around important review ask shall start interior exterior interior exterior ok let go interior much say everything basic per everything overdrive rear frost also digital odometer daytime run light something see cars maybe separate cars car provide good amount room unless professional wrestle probably fit car room back good room front however drivers side little

362,camera, i just purchased my dimage 5 a couple days ago  and i have to say i m impressed  first off  the salesmen at best buy  and wolf camera both shook their heads and said that it ate batteries so fast that they absolutely couldn t recommend it  well  i m happy to say that alkalines are shot in under 10 minutes  but rechargable nickel metal hydride batteries lasted me for over 1 1 2 hours of constant usage before dying  i popped off over 100 photos  30 of which i used a flash for  not bad considering  i bought three sets of batteries and a charger at best buy for  60 00  that should buy me about 4 hours of constant usage  i m not trying to focus just on the batteries  but i know that was my main concern  and i haven t read much real world feedback on that subject yet  my conclusion  battery situation is not as bad as it sounds next  it took me a good 2 hours to finally take a good picture  i know nothing about slr cameras  so i had to take a crash course off the web in aperature setting  exposure value  and iso setting etc  the auto mode takes decent pictures  but the auto focus is a tad slow  if you use the flex focus feature though  focusing is a breeze  there are alot of tweakable features for the real camera buff  i m not going to pretend to be an expert  but i took a picture in near darkness  and it looked great  i took several others  and they all ended up looking pretty stellar  i m amazed at the quality of the macro shots  they are absolutely beautiful  the 7x optical zoom is phenomenal  that was the clincher for me  i love having all of that play  a 2x zoom just doesn t cut it for me  it s a solid camera  it doesn t get as hot as everyone reports  in fact  i find it hard to tell if it s warm from the batteries  or because it s warming up from my hand  the picture quality is far superior to my cybershot 3 2 megapixel by sony  i printed out a photo of about 20x16 at full res on the map printer at work  beautiful  photos printed on my hp deskjet on kodak photo paper were mouth watering  i ve been using a canon powershot  and a sony cybershot for the last year  this camera is in a whole different class  if you ve got the time to learn a little about basic photography  you too can be taking artsy fartsy shots like me in only a few days i highly recommend this camera  this is from not a photography expert  but from an average joe who s starting at square one  any specific questions  e mail me   steve steve lynch com ,purchase damage couple days ago say impress first salesman best buy wolf camera shake head say eat batteries fast absolutely recommend well happy say alkaline shoot minutes rechargable nickel metal hydrate batteries last hours constant usage die pop photo use flash bad consider buy three set batteries charge best buy buy hours constant usage try focus batteries know main concern read much real world feedback subject yet conclusion battery situation bad sound next take good hours finally take good picture know nothing sir camera take crash course web aperture set exposure value iso set etc auto mode take decent picture auto focus slow use flex focus feature though rouse breeze clot tweakable feature real camera buff go pretend expert take picture near darkness look great take several others end look pretty cellar amaze quality micro shots absolutely beautiful optical room phenomena clinch love play room cut solid camera get hot everyone report fact find hard tell warm batteries warm hand picture quality far superior cybershot megapixel sonya print photo full yes map printer work beautiful photo print deseret today photo paper mouth water use canon powershot sonya cybershot last year camera whole different class get time learn little basic photography take arts party shots like days highly recommend camera photography expert average joe start square one specific question mail steve lynch com

366,camera, this is a pretty good camera for the money which boasts a number of usable features  2 1 pix and interchangable memory cards make for an easy way to get lots of snapshots at a reasonable quality p i use this for taking everyday pictures of my daughter and other family stuff  it s not a serious photographers camera  but few digitals are at that point yet  you need to purchase the larger memory cards  mine came with a 4 mb one and i immediately bought a 16mb  which somedays is even to little at 1200x1600 p the controls are good  easily understood and placed well  the camera itself fits naturally in the hand  though is a little large to carry around everyday everywhere  a friend of mine has a canon s10  i think  which is way smaller and a no brainer to flip in your pocket p though i haven t run into a problem with the battery life  i can see it being a problem  i always charge the thing the night before i know i will use it to be safe and usually the day night will end before the battery does  though conservative use of flash is needed p also not sure about the durability  though it looks like a metal casing  it s really plastic  and feels like it ll break with even the slightest mistouch p the one thing that really bugs me about this is taking snaps with the flash  there is a way noticable delay between initial flash and actual picture  compounded when the red eye reduction is on  double flash essentially  so the subjects move  thinking the picture is taken  and the pictures end up blurred  perhaps it s inexperience at digital photography  and i will play with settings and whatnot to see if that helps  but it s annoying p overall  it s a good unit  and has paid for itself in the memories captured where they wouldn t have been with a regular camera  too much bother to load film  reload film  take for processing  etc  ,pretty good camera money boat number unable feature six interchangeable memory card make easy way get lot snapshots reasonable quality use take everyday picture daughter family stuff serious photographer camera digital point yet need purchase larger memory card mine come mb one immediately buy mb someday even little control good easily understand place well camera fit naturally hand though little large carry around everyday everywhere friend mine canon think way smaller trainer lip pocket though run problem battery life see problem always charge thing night know use safe usually day night end battery though conservative use flash need also sure disability though look like metal cause really plastic feel like break even slightest mistouch one thing really bag take snap flash way noticeable delay initial flash actual picture compound red eye reduction double flash essentially subject move think picture take picture end blur perhaps inexperience digital photography play settings whatnot see help annoy overall good unit pay memories capture regular camera much bother load film reload film take process etc

370,camera, i bought the epson 3000z after comparing its  features to other 3 3 megapixel cameras  compared to the olympus 3030  i preferred the 3000z s use of compact flash  compared to the sony dsc s70  i preferred the 3000z s use of compact flash  smartmedia i might consider  but i can t think of a good excuse for memory sticks  and ergonomics  i wanted a 3x zoom  so the canon s 20 was out  the nikon coolpix 990 also closely fit my specs  but i found with an earlier nikon 900 that battery life was a big issue and that the twist body doesn t suit me  so i thought i d try another brand my experience so far with the 3000z has been mixed  the camera can take very good pictures  the lens is fast and sharp  a tiff mode is available  battery life is very good  on the other hand  the shutter button does not give good tactile feedback  which makes pre focusing an adventure  i haven t quite gotten to the bottom of the problem  but in some modes focusing is error prone  leading to a number of blurry  throw away pictures  also  the highest quality setting for jpegs results in files of only about 1 meg or less  apparent quality is fine  but i would prefer to be able to save a larger  less lossy jpeg  tiffs are available  but a real problem because they tie up the camera for about 20 seconds while saving at the time i bought the camera  i also purchased a canon eos 3  one of canon s best prosumer 35mm bodies  which i find to be an interesting contrast  the price is not that far apart  i took both on a trip recently  the eos 3 has many more options available to set parameters around a photograph  and much more sophisticated metering and focusing systems  it has a teriffic viewfinder  when you press the shutter it really conveys the sense that you have just taken a good picture  in contrast  the 3000z is smaller and more convenient  but it seems like a toy by comparison   or more accurately like a cheap point and shoot camera on my return i had the film developed  and it was pretty clear that i was more successful taking the pictures i wanted to take with the eos 3  but the development and print process introduces variables  and my preferred output device normally is a computer screen  so after development i use a film scanner to scan the best pictures  this takes time and introduces more variables  what the 3000z has going for it is immediate accessibility in digital form and generally accurate color balance which requires little correction my overall verdict on the 3000z is that it is a frustrating product  and frustratingly close to being good  simple usability problems prevent the camera from being satisfactory  but it can produce good results with a little luck  i m still a strong believer in digital photography  we re just not there yet with the 3000z     ,buy elson compare feature megapixel camera compare polypus prefer use compact flash compare sonya duc prefer use compact flash smartmedia might consider think good excuse memory stick economics want room canon union coolpix also closely fit speck find earlier union battery life big issue twist body suit think try another brand experience far mix camera take good picture lens fast sharp stiff mode available battery life good hand shutter button give good tactile feedback make pre rouse adventure quite get bottom problem modes rouse error prone lead number flurry throw away picture also highest quality set peg result file meg less apparent quality fine would prefer able save larger less loss peg liffs available real problem tie camera second save time buy camera also purchase canon os one canon best presume mm body find interest contrast price far apart take trip recently os many option available set parameter around photograph much sophisticate meet rouse systems traffic viewfinder press shutter really convey sense take good picture contrast smaller convenient seem like toy comparison accurately like cheap point shoot camera return film develop pretty clear successful take picture want take os development print process introduce variable prefer output device normally computer screen development use film scan scan best picture take time introduce variable go immediate inaccessibility digital form generally accurate color balance require little correction overall verdict frustration product frustratingly close good simple liability problems prevent camera satisfactory produce good result little luck still strong believer digital photography yet
371,camera, about a year ago  i purchased a 775 from dell  900 pictures later  i m happy with the money i spent on this camera  310 after price matching the biggest advantage to this camera is its size  sure  there are many cameras out there that will provide superior picture quality and have setting adjustments that will appease the most advanced of photographers  but with most of those cameras  you have to think twice before you bring it with you  i ve captured many great moments with this camera because i didn t have to think twice  it fits in your pocket with ease and you ll soon forget that it s even there  it s made out of plastic  so it looks almost like a toy  but it s well made and very sturdy  i dropped it once and it still works fine  the picture quality is good  not great  colors are represented well  but not as vibrant as some of the other digital cameras that i ve seen  the pictures do come out a little soft  but this can be corrected by using the sharpening function in photoshop  i ve printed many 4x6 pictures from the camera  and most of the pictures look quite nice  haven t tried 8x10 yet  the downside of this camera is it s slow startup time  it takes a good 10 seconds for the camera to be ready to go  picture to picture downtime is less  but probably still slow overall  i think the slowness might be due to the memory card i m using because i remember the camera being faster when i still had the 8 mb card that it came with  once you get used to it  the slowness of the camera is not a major concern  you just have to think ahead a little before you take a picture if all your picture taking consists of point and shoot pictures  then the 775 is a great option  even if you are a professional photographer  i think you will still find some use for it because of it s portability  you ll take pictures that you never would have taken before because you ll have this camera there for those unexpected moments  ,year ago purchase well picture later happy money spend camera price watch biggest advantage camera size sure many camera provide superior picture quality set adjustments appease advance photographer camera think twice bring capture many great moments camera think twice fit pocket ease soon forget even make plastic look almost like toy well make sturdy drop still work fine picture quality good great color represent well vagrant digital camera see picture come little soft correct use sharpen function photoshop print many picture camera picture look quite nice try yet downside camera slow start time take good second camera ready go picture picture downtime less probably still slow overall think slowness might due memory card use remember camera faster still mb card come get use slowness camera major concern think ahead little take picture picture take consist point shoot picture great option even professional photographer think still find use probability take picture never would take camera unexpected moments
372,camera, my mother in law has one of these cameras and i would say that out of all i have seen that this is a camera that is very easy to use it takes no time for you to snap your pictures  and load them onto your computer or floppy disk it actually takes really good pictures  she doesn t use a regular camera anymore now that she can get her pictures and see how they turned out just minutes after she takes them the polaroid photomax camera is at the top of my list because it is so easy to use and it comes with a great program that enables you to make several things and even print your pictures on a sheet of paper in multiple numbers i  myself  rather like that option because it saves you time on trying to get the exact size and having to go back each time to print more that one of the same size  you can do it all at once it is my opinion that if you ever use the camera that you will love it and the program that comes with it br br  ,mother law one camera would say see camera easy use take time snap picture load onto computer floppy disk actually take really good picture use regular camera anymore get picture see turn minutes take polaroid potomac camera top list easy use come great program enable make several things even print picture sheet paper multiple number rather like option save time try get exact size go back time print one size opinion ever use camera love program come br
373,camera, i think the basic feature list has been covered more than sufficiently in other reviews  so i d like to concentrate more on what i have done and discovered with my 880 b picture quality  i have been waiting until 3  megapixel cameras became reasonably priced  with that level of detail  you can make great looking 8x10 s  or have enough detail to crop and zoom  when necessary the 880 produces great looking pictures  with lots of detail and color  other reviews commented on how sharp the pictures looked  it took me a while to realize that  sharpness  was turned on by default  while this may actually make for a very sharp snapshot  in some cases  too much sharpness will cause  ringing   or fringing  around objects  which may affect enlargements more than snapshots  i have one shot in particular that would have been much better without this artifact  since i can always sharpen in my photo software  i prefer this option to be off  and then i will sharpen when i want  when i have photos printed  uploaded to a web site  and they send back the prints  they look fantastic  i think pictures look better than those taken with my automatic 35mm  digital photography is finally here b taking pictures  i really don t make much use of the  scene  modes  although  i do think that they might come in handy when you don t have the time to mess with the manual feature and or don t remember what settings to use  typically  putting it into  auto  will take good shots most of the time  i can hand the camera to someone else  and there s no mystery  this is particularly an important feature if you want more manual control  but your spouse does not   here s a feature that is better than a typical 35mm automatic camera  it will focus through glass  at a subject  rather than focusing on the glass   with an autofocus camera  you often have to go into landscape infinity mode and hope for the best  or manually adjust the focus distance  if that feature is available  on the 880  it is also possible to manually set the distance  but not while in the automatic mode the manual modes were a selling point for me  there are some other cameras that have a wider range of manual adjustments  canon g1  i think  so the 880 is a bit of a compromise  however  if you re like me and trying to move beyond the beginner stage and take more interesting pictures  it provides a lot more options beyond the usual automatic camera settings  if you re an experienced photographer who is used to an slr  there may not be enough adjustments for you if you have stitching software  the 880 has an  ae lock  mode which will allow you to take several pictures with the same exposure settings  this allows you to create panoramas and have the same exposure across the entire panorama   without such a setting  each picture would get a different brightness or even color  and it could be an unpleasant effect when you stitch them together  don t forget to  reset  or turn  off  the ae lock mode when done  i have done a couple of neat 360 pictures  viewable on the computer  but it s hard to find a situation where there s something nice to look at in all directions   i have tried using the bss  best shot selector  but it seems too inconsistent to me  it s supposed to take multiple shots and choose the ones with the least amount of blur  but perhaps the real problem is that it s too easy to take a blurry shot that brings me to one of the negative points  and perhaps this affects other digital cameras  however  most of my experience is with this camera  so i can t compare    it s very easy to blur pictures  particularly in low light situations  it does a fantastic job of giving you a picture in low light conditions  but it needs to hold the shutter open longer to do so  as long as the camera is very stable  and the subject doesn t move much  you can get a great shot with very natural looking lighting  i really like to attempt these shots  however  many photos turn up blurry  with a flash  you get a stable picture even in lower light conditions  but then the battery is drained even faster  i also do not always like the harshness of flash   sometimes it looks good  sometimes not   not to mention that the flash is only suitable if the subject is within several feet  if you can stabilize the camera  say  by resting it on something or leaning against something  you can get more stable shots even without a tripod  that technique has been helpful  particularly when i am fortunate enough to be able to line up the shot and use the timer so that my hand does not even touch it when it snaps the picture i think it is worth noting that often times the  blur  that people notice is mostly when zooming in on the detail of the picture  if printed as a 4x6 snapshot  you often will not see a problem  or not enough to bother the eye  at 3  megapixels  that s far more resolution than is needed for a 4x6  so you have to consider that it looks worse when zoomed  in other words  if you had the same amount of camera shake using a lower resolution 2 megapixel camera  when you zoomed into the latter  it would appear  less blurred  but you re really looking at less detail as well having said all of that  i spend a lot of time trying to compensate to avoid blurring shaking it s worth noting that the camera defaults to  normal  picture quality mode  i always use  fine  mode  which doubles the size of the picture  but reduces the jpeg artifacts to a very low level  if you can afford the memory  you might as well get the clearest pictures possible if you run low on memory  and you know you don t need anything more than 4x6  prints  you can lower the resolution and take quite a few more pictures  i only do that when i m desperate and fill up my memory  which i do pretty often  actually  i d rather have more detail than i need  rather than the other way around b accessories  boy  are they expensive  you pretty much need to buy the power adapter and battery  though  not to mention a larger cf card i might like to get additional filters or lenses  but they are a bit pricey  also  the remote shutter trigger is very expensive for a case  i purchased a small lowepro which is built tough with lots of padding  the 880 fits this particular model like a glove  they have an entire series for digital cameras that has slots for holding memory cards  batteries  and other handy features b software  the main thing i thought was interesting about the included software was the  limited edition  fractal file format plugin  using this  only works as a plugin to certain paint programs  you can load pictures and enlarge them to much higher resolutions  and it fills in detail better than typical paint software  this works best if you at least have good detail in the original picture  without blurring shaking  however  i haven t found this to be as useful as i expected  as 3 megapixels seems to do a fine job of 8x10s b summary  i m very happy with the output of the camera  and i enjoy experimenting with the extra features  my wife enjoys the automatic mode  and claims to be happy with the results  ,think basic feature list cover sufficiently review

374,camera, been using the canon digital elph s110 powershot after having used the sony mavica family of cameras as well as the kodak dc 280 and 3400  i have to say that the canon s100 is by far the best  for all the same features  you get with the other cameras  you get so much more with the canon  it s got a small form factor that really makes it so convenient to carry around  that s the huge advantage with this camera  who wants to lug around their beastly sony mavica around after using this   and who wants to use floppy disks anyways after using the s100 for awhile  i traded up to the s110  it s got the same fantastic size as the s100 and improved optics  the addition of the movie mode for small avi movies is great  otherwise there s little difference between the s100 and s110  and i heartily recommend both  the included software package for both mac and pc is great  with easy setup and lots of great features  just another reason to go with canon digital cameras it s easy to set up  and the picture quality is fantastic  you can t beat that  my only gripes  canon doesn t include a spare battery  the stock compact flash card is only 8 mb  and there is no case included  kinda cheap for a camera that is really nice the powershot s110 features an elegant  stainless steel  sus316  body equipped with a number of advanced camera features including a 35 70mm  35mm equivalent  f 2 8 4 0 all glass aspherical lens to help minimize image distortion  a 4x digital converter extends the zoom range of the lens to 8x when used in conjunction with its 2x optical zoom capabilities  in addition  the camera is equipped with a three point aiaf autofocus system that permits the camera to automatically select the primary subject  even if the subject is off center  to further simplify overall operation  the digital elph displays most camera settings on the lcd monitor  while using the control buttons at the base of the monitor  users can confirm desired camera functions identified on the lcd monitor with easy to understand icons or minimal text  the digital elph features a 0 37 inch  2 1 megapixel ccd sensor that creates full color or black and white images up to 1600x1200 pixels when set to the camera s large resolution mode  the camera also offers an additional resolution setting of 640 x 480 when set in the small mode  which is ideal for on screen applications  such as web sites and cd roms and allows more images to be recorded on a single compactflash memory card  the new camera is compatible with type i compactflash cards and will be shipped with an 8mb cf card  in order to maximize the capabilities of the 2 1 megapixel ccd  the powershot s100 is equipped with a dedicated digital signal processing integrated circuit  ic  to achieve high speed and complete processing of image detail  all images are recorded as jpeg files and a built in buffer memory allows continuous burst mode shooting of up to 2 frames per second when set to its maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200  the interval between shots in single frame mode is only 1 7 seconds  in addition  basic operations such as camera start up  high speed search mode during playback  image enlargement and image scrolling can now be executed swiftly  due to the digital signal processing ic s high speed compression and decompression operations  the photo quality i get from printing pics from ofoto com is fantastic  sharp and easy on the eyes  costco recently started printing pictures too  their quality is similiar to ofoto com  and lest costly  color saturation is not quite as rich though  with a few pics looking more greenish i got mine from outpost com because they had free shipping and no tax  yay  also  if you shop through ebates  you get another 5  back   you can use them free to shop at many

378,camera, as a first digital camera  i feel that the polaroid photomax 640 with imagemaker software is tops  at under  200 at wal mart  it has all the features that a novice could want  it features a wide range of resolution options  allowing from 12 to 96 images to be stored on the memory card  it has three range settings and 4 flash settings  i have used mine for about three months and have had wonderful results  my only complaint is the loss of sharpness in enlargements  the imagemaker software has many options for making and printing pictures  such as printing multiple copies  and multiple sizes of a picture on a single sheet of paper  the software also allows you to email your pictures with music  great frames and backgrounds  i would recommend this package to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive first digital camera that does a lot of things that the more expensive cameras do     ,first digital camera feel polaroid potomac imagemaker software top mary feature novice could want feature wide range resolution option allow image store memory card three range settings flash settings use mine three months wonderful result complaint loss sharpness enlargements imagemaker software many option make print picture print multiple copy multiple size picture single sheet paper software also allow email picture music great frame background would recommend package anyone look expensive first digital camera lot things expensive camera
379,auto,  the folks at hyundai must be in the middle of a grandiose manic episode  they just finished pulling off introducing the hyundai santa fe into the mini suv market  and now they plan on attacking the highly competitive mid sized sedan market head on  will they accomplish it with this new entry  i wondered that myself b i had first seen the xg300 in a local auto show that came into town  i was impressed by the clean lines and upscale look  though i found the overall appearance a little sedated  even so  upon further inspection  i could tell hyundai was up to something  especially when i looked at the sticker price  as we all know  however  a low msrp doesn t necessarily translate into success for a car  so i decided to take the xg300 for a spin   again  for you san antonians  the red mccomb s pontiac hyundai is a sleezy place  and i would recommend you look elsewhere  they do  however  have a huge volume of cars i b exterior  8  i ll admit it  i was humbled by this car at one point  when i first saw it on the road  i thought it was a lincoln at first glance  from the front  the xg300 certainly does look stately  complete with its large grille and standard fog lamps  when i saw the car s profile  though  its true marque was given away  yes  this was the new xg300  as i alluded to previously  the xg300 certainly makes an impression on those who see it  however  it may be a little dull for some  sporting the  buick y  wheel covers  how  bout some spokes or something  hyundai the xg300 is about the size of a nissan maxima  and larger than its little brother  the sonata  one of my only troubling observations was its thin tires  although they are v rated michelins  their width seemed a little  wimpy  my fear upon seeing this was wallowy handling b interior  8  at first glance  i thought i was sitting in a much more expensive vehicle  granted  one needs only a few seconds to realize that this is just a  budget luxury  car  hyundai was generous with fake wood appointments  and the plastic  while not cheap feeling  certainly wasn t  lexus par  either  all of this was to be expected of course  and all in all  i found the interior pleasing to the eye the dash  for instance  has a very clean appearance  with a flat button layout imitating a style you d find on higher end cars  the radio is placed high enough to be operated safely  even though the climate controls are placed on the lowest part of the dash  they were easy to use without taking my eyes off the road the stereo didn t blow me away  but i feel it s on par with cars in this class  yes  that includes the accord and company  the well positioned tweeters produced pure highs  while the 6 5  door mounted woofers thumped decent bass  rear occupants may ask you to lower the volume  i could tell some larger speakers resided in the back  though i couldn t tell how big they were  6x9  is my best guess  the face is easy to read and use  with one notable exception  there is no volume knob  but rather the up and down button variety  i found this to be a real pain  because it took a lot of pushing to get the volume where i wanted it  also included is a preset equalizer  where you can set the levels to  rock  live  classic  and flat  a six cd changer is optional  i d personally recommend it  or an after market one climate controls worked smoothly and quietly  it was a hot day in san antonio  but i didn t notice  the xg300 is roomy on all fronts  head room  leg room  and hip room were all impressive  this car can seat five comfortably  i use that last word loosely because as was the case during my drive of the sonata  i could not seem to find a comfortable seating position  the seats are woefully lacking in lumbar  lateral  and butt  support  i would easily fatigue after driving an extended period of time b engine  8  the 3 0l v6 churns out 192hp  off the line and especially on the highway  i found the engine to accelerate comfortably  official times for 0 to 60 are around nine seconds  which isn t bad  but not great  either  the automatic transmission shifts quickly and smoothly  though i found it a bit hesitant at times while passing  it would also downshift needlessly on occasion  the  h matic  is a standard manumatic feature  where you can slide the shifter away from you  it should be towards you  and flick the wrist up or down to shift  i just left it in automatic after playing with it for a while i note  hyundai has announced a 3 5l v6 will soon be coming into the line up  this should provide the xg300 with some impressive go power i b ride  7  while the xg300 rides smoothly  it rides perhaps a little too softly  big bumps will cause the whole body to undulate up and down  much like the old buicks once did  engine noise is impressively dampened  and little road or wind noise could be detected b handling  6  my rating may seem a bit harsh  but i guess i was expecting better out of this car  there is an appreciable amount of body roll with even moderately sharp curves  and the little tires squeal if pushed just a little  i don t feel the xg300 is a dangerous handler  but it certainly won t be mistaken for a sports sedan  either  true  that s not what this car is being marketed as  but i still expected better braking is pretty impressive  though when i hit the brakes hard  i could sense some fade  and the nose dove quite a bit b safety   b crash tests are pending  i ll update my review as soon as i see them b build quality  5  unfortunately  i think hyundai may have a few kinks to iron out here  i heard a rattle coming from the rear seat when i hit bumps  and some interior materials didn t look like they could stand up to abuse  the doors shudder and rattle when you slam them  the power controls didn t even work every time i pushed them  not good  i found this surprising because even the build quality of the economy class  elantra  inspired more confidence out of me when i drove it  having read other professional reviews noting the same troubles  it seems i am not alone in this opinion  as sean connery would say   pity b value  8  no question  the xg300 has got an impressive bang for your buck factor  as do many hyundai cars  the fully loaded xg300  l  for under  25 grand  and this includes standard leather seats  power adjustable front seats  remote keyless entry with alarm  a six speaker stereo system with cd player  power moonroof  memory driver seat and outside mirrors  heated front seats  and an auto dimming rear mirror  i would have given this car a  9  as far as value is concerned  but alas  resale value is expected to be poor  don t ask me how these things are determined  if you know  drop me a line  but either way  it doesn t bode well for when you want to sell the thing the questionable build quality may translate into a high cost of ownership  but at least there s an impressive warranty to balance some of that out b verdict  there s some promise here  but i d wait b the xg300 is a clear and promising indicator of where hyndai wants to go with its cars  however  it seems to me that the company may have  jumped the gun  with the xg300  perhaps a little patience and more extensive testing on their part would have produced a better finished vehicle  still  for those who are looking for a cheaper alternative  i d be hard pressed not to recommend you at least give the xg300 a look  if it were me  and mind was set on the xg300  i d wait a year or two in hopes that build quality issues could be straightened out  if hyundai came out with a  sport  suspension and meatier tires  that d be nice  too b average score for the xg300  7 14 out of 10  b vara s personal rating  7 0 out of 10  ,folks hyundai must middle grandiose panic episode finish pull

380,auto, i love my highlander  we got the limited and it is the most comfortable and smoothest riding suv i have been in  the interior is set up well and everything is easy to get to  the in dash cd changer is a great option i would recommend  the seats are very comfortable and although i havent been a big fan of leather in the past these seats are great the engine is very quiet and gets good gas mileage for a 6 cyl suv  while road noise is also minimal there is a strange aerodynamic issue when only the rear windows are rolled down  at highway speeds it sounds  and feels  like a helicopter is taking off  opening one of the other windows or sun roof alleviates the problem though so for us it s a minor one the handling is also top notch for an suv  it drives very much like a car  it should  it s on the camery frame  and i have never felt like it wanted to roll over i had an explorer  or  exploder  as the toyota salesman called them  previously and it was loaded with options so i do miss a few of the simple things i had before like a compartment just for kleenex and a change dispenser  these are small items  but i consciously miss them now that i dont have them  but the ride of the highlander never makes me miss the explorer  ,love highlander get limit comfortable smooth rid sun interior set well everything easy get dash change great option would recommend seat comfortable although big fan leather past seat great engine quiet get good gas mileage cy sun road noise also minimal strange aerodynamic issue rear windows roll highway speed sound feel like helicopter take open one windows sun roof alleviate problem though us minor one handle also top notch sun drive much like car camera frame never felt like want roll explorer explorer tooth salesman call previously load option miss simple things like compartment keener change dispense small items consciously miss dont ride highlander never make miss explorer
381,camera, i received this camera as a gift  i had been wanting a digital camera for some time but i could not find my way through the maze of pixels and options  i have talked to friends  searched on zdnet and other helpful websites  the decision making was the hardest part  the surprise gift made the choice a lot easier  after using this camera at a wedding i feel comfortable recommending it as a great place to start i love gadgets and love researching them as many of my gender does  there are so many cameras in this new market i found it hard to start looking  how many pixels do you need is the first question to answer  2 2 do a mighty fine job as it turns out  this camera has options for full and half resolution  within these 2 levels there are an additional 3 levels of resolution  in my first few minutes with the camera i could see the difference on the lcd screen  with an 8mb smartmedia card to start with  i chose the middle of the road  on both levels  to start  it has a great balance of clarity and storage  once the wedding began i used the higher resolution settings and the pictures came out awesome  of course the batteries had already been changed once having battery options is another very nice feature of this camera  since it flies through the juice  being able to use disposable or rechargeable batteries is a great option  i have a rechargeable battery kit now and will try to use this as the greenest solution whenever possible to be honest  i don t like to read really long reviews on epinions so   i will summarize below the features of this camera i think are great are this 1 smartmedia card storage   it is easy to use and small 2 usb cable interface   i know usb 2 is faster but this was still pretty fast for what i need 3 uses regular aa batteries in either the alkaline or rechargeable format  you can always find aa batteries in a pinch  try finding a photo specialized battery when you need one 4 lcd screen  you can review your pictures right away 5 perfect resolution  2 2 mega pixel  options for a weekend vacation photographer  my kids look great in the pictures 6 you can watch the pictures on the tv with the other cables included  pretty neat i thought 7 power cord available to charge batteries in the camera 8 easy to download pictures to the photo album software 9 compact size things i thought could be better 1 battery consumption seems ferocious  i barely made it through a single 8mb card before i ran out 2 the lcd viewfinder is worthless for taking pictures at night  it works fine for viewing pictures anytime 3 the pixel resolution icons didn t  make sense at first  this from someone who does not like to use the instructions unless under duress  once i figured it out it makes a lot more sense 4 it is hard to see through the standard viewer if you have a moderate sized nose  this aspect is inevitable when you go with a compact size  i can overlook it 5 the software included could be a bit easier to use  i can t imagine my techno phobic mother trying to figure out how to use the computer connection and software for this 6 you have to get used to the delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken  i got quite a few shots of the scene i moved my hands to not the scene i intended  once you get the delay figured out it is really no big deal 7 there is no sound or movie option  there is a multi shot feature that makes a quasi movie  overall this is a winner of a package for my first camera  i am sure i will want more in the future  by then i think i will be better able to afford all those cool features  for a simple high quality camera i like this one  ,receive camera gift want digital camera time could find way make pip option talk friends search net helpful webster decision make hardest part surprise gift make choice lot easier use camera wed feel comfortable recommend great place start love badge love search many gender many camera new market find hard start

382,auto, in late 2000  when my 1989 toyota celica started to die  i began the search for my new car  my prerequisites  compact car  good ride  good warranty  and overall value  we had recently splurged on a 2000 toyota camry  and while we love that car  i was not willing to spend camry type money on a car that would be my workhorse in commutes ind business trips  i also wanted a car that looked nice  and had some good bells and whistles  like power everything  cruise control  and a cd player  while i love toyotas  i knew that those extra bells and whistles would cost too much then along came the hyundai  the reviews on the 2001 hyundai elantra were quite remarkable  with most reviewers saying that it was better than the toyota corolla  my first choice  the 2001 elantra was newly redesigned  and the warranty could not be surpassed i was skeptical  until i took the car for a test drive  it took corners better than my celica had  and its shocks   instead of struts   made for a smooth ride over bumpy terrain when it came time to negotiate  i was able to purchase the car for less than invoice  with the help of edmunds com  edmunds showed me the rebates available on the car  including a  500 manufacturer rebate at the time i was looking to buy  armed with the invoice price of every piece of optional equipment i sought to include on the car  the dealer soon agreed to my asking price  in this economy  the car buyer is king real world driving of the elantra is even better than the test drive  it is a very quiet car  even at high speeds  acceleration is decent for an automatic  but it is my understanding that the car is even better as a 5 speed  the climate control on the air conditioner is good  maybe even a little too cold for my tastes at times  there is plenty of leg room in front and back  comfortably seating four tall men  the stereo system is good  and the optional cd player is a nice addition  while the cruise control is difficult to figure out  without reading the manual  it is easy to program while driving my only two critiques of the car are the front seats and the trunk  the front seats are narrower than other foreign cars  and the seatbelt is positioned irregularly  making it difficult to fasten while driving  which  of course  you shouldn t do anyway  my ample hips fit snugly in the bucket seats up front  but not uncomfortably the trunk is a little too narrow  and the trunk cover is made of cheap materials  this is surprising on a car which is very well made otherwise all in all  this is a great car  it is also a great looking car  which adds to its appeal  although the resale value of it is questionable  for anyone looking to own a car for the long haul  it s a great deal  ,late tooth relics start die begin search new car prerequisites compact car good ride good warranty overall value recently plunge tooth carry love car will spend carry type money car would workhouse commute ind business trip also want car look nice good bell whistle like power everything cruise control player love toyotas know extra bell whistle would cost much along come hyundai review hyundai plantar quite remarkable review say better tooth coolly first choice plantar newly design warranty could surpass skeptically take car test drive take corner better relics shock instead strut make smooth ride bump terrain come time negotiate able purchase car less voice help edmund com edmund show rebate available car include manufacturer debate time look buy arm voice price every piece optional equipment seek include car dealer soon agree ask price economy car buyer king real world drive plantar even better test drive quiet car even high speed acceleration decent automatic understand car even better speed climate control air condition good maybe even little cold taste time plenty leg room front back comfortably seat four tall men sterno system good optional player nice addition cruise control difficult figure without read manual easy program drive two critique car front seat trunk front seat narrow foreign cars seatbelt position irregularly make difficult fasten drive course anyway ample hips fit snugly bucket seat front uncomfortable trunk little narrow trunk cover make cheap materials surprise car well make otherwise great car also great look car add appeal although result value questionable anyone look car long haul great deal
383,camera, as an avid photographer and writer on digital imaging  i bought this camera for day to day photography as well as to shoot images for my books and articles on photoshop  after a couple of weeks shooting with it  i confess that i am totally hooked  and i may need to get a second one just to keep my boyfriend from stealing mine all the time since i take a lot of action shots  primarily kids  i was very concerned about the shutter lag that is so common in digital cameras  i had shot with some other models and found them completely frustrating  since i m used to shooting with an slr  i expect the shutter to trip exactly when i hit the button  i m finding this is hardly a problem with the g2 i spent a few hours playing with and photographing my 10 month old nephew the other night and really had no complaints  the g2 offers a very good auto setting  the flash seems to perform very well most of my auto exposures have been dead on  it also offer program settings with exposure compensation  manual focus  etc  for those tricky to meter subjects  metering and focusing works well and very intuitively one of my favorite features is the camcorder style  flip out lcd screen  this lets you use the camera from any conceivable angle with mimimal effort  when photographing kids  you can rotate the screen and shoot from waist height without even bending over  conversely  you can rotate the screen down and shoot with the camera over your head great for shots in crowds  it also rotates so you can take a self portrait battery life has been impressive  we shot on christmas day  maybe 200 shots at highest file size over the course of the day  with the lcd on and flash used on most shots  and didn t get a low battery warning for about 8 hours the camera software was also easy to install and works perfectly  even if  like me  you are too lazy to read the manual  comes with a photoshop plug in for importing photos that i like better than the canon stand alone software  the plug in offers better titling options  also  i installed this on a mac running os9 1  so mac addicts should have no problems i ve made 8x10s that look very nice and feel i could probably go to 11x14 with good results i was a little resistant to going digital at last  but this was a terrific first experience i may finally have to give up my traditional darkroom  ,aid photographer writer digital imagine buy camera day day photography well shoot image book article photoshop couple weeks shoot confess totally hook may need get second one keep boyfriend steal mine time since take lot action shots primarily kiss concern shutter law common digital camera shoot model find completely frustration since use shoot sir expect shutter trip exactly hit button find hardly problem spend hours play photographic month old nephew night really complaints offer good auto set flash seem perform well auto exposures dead also offer program settings exposure compensation manual focus etc tricky peter subject meet rouse work well intuitively one favorite feature camcorder style lip lead screen let use camera conceivable angle minimal effort photographic kiss rotate screen shoot waist height without even bend conversely rotate screen shoot camera head great shots crowd also rotate take self portrait battery life impressive shoot christmas day maybe shots highest file size course day lead flash use shots get low battery warn hours camera software also easy install work perfectly even like lazy read manual come photoshop plug import photo like better canon stand alone software plug offer better till option also instal mac run os mac admit problems make look nice feel could probably go good result little resistant go digital last terrific first experience may finally give traditional darkroom
384,camera, you have probably seen many of your friends or family carrying around a digital camera at various functions  digital cameras are great because you don t need to pay to develop film and you can e mail them to anyone or put them on a web page  also  you can carry pictures around on a small disk and edit them at your leisure  in this review i am going to list the pros and cons that come along with purchasing this product  since the cons outweigh the pros  you will understand why i don t recommend the canon powershot g1 digital camera pros battery digital cameras use a lot of energy  in addition  many cameras either have a small battery  to save weight and cost  or are not supplied with rechargeable batteries  the g1 comes with a good sized liion battery  which is also used by some canon camcorders  so it is fairly inexpensive  the battery is excellent  and you can take more than 500 pictures without having to recharge it  raw file format while the low compression jpeg files the camera produces are fine for snapshots  for serious work  where you will edit the image on computer  some kind of raw image format are necessary  canon use a proprietary no loss compression scheme to achieve a sub 3mb raw file size  other companies produce tiff files  which are much larger and waste valuable cf storage space and take longer to download  in easier terms  the raw format uses 1 3 of the space an uncompressed tiff uses  this feature is very useful  for you can set up white point  contrast  sharpness and saturation without losing any image quality  if you are taking critical pictures  this is the best feature that the camera has to offer finally  the picture quality is very good  but so is the quality of pictures taken by most cameras in this price rage cons optical viewfinder the viewfinder is small and ridiculously hard to use  it is a rip off that canon s optical viewfinders are so poorly designed and constructed  most sony cameras are equipped with vastly superior optical viewfinders  my biggest problem is that the viewfinder does not provide parallax compensation  believe me when i say that despite all the good features that this camera has  the optical viewfinder problem makes this camera not worth the troubles it will cause you cheap quality from the time i bought this camera  i knew it would not hold up  i take my camera everywhere i go  mostly outside  and although i have been careful  the g1 has very flimsy parts  i can also say that i have friends who own this camera and had parts break and even the camera itself has needed extensive repairs  if this is not enough to convince you not to buy this camera  read my conclusion conclusion this camera has good features but so do other cameras that are cheaper in price  the price of digital cameras is dropping rapidly and i strongly urge you to wait until the price of better quality cameras go down  i cannot recommend the canon powershot g1 because i believe that for its price  799  it will become obsolete too fast  please  wait about half a year and purchase a better digital camera  online stores such as www amazon com or www cnet com have great prices  however  if you must buy a camera now  check out the sony digital cameras   canon powershot g1 features  high resolution  3 34 million pixel ccd image sensor  fast  3x optical zoom lens  34  102mm f 2 0  2 5

385,camera, i ve only had this camera for 2 weeks but i am stunned at the quality of the photos it takes compared to my kodak dc240  i have not played with many of the settings or the manual overrides as yet but in auto mode it takes superb photos   just pull it out of the box  put the batteries in and start snapping  low light performance is just so much better than lesser cameras  it has a remote control too  why  hmmmm  not sure  but it s nice all the same  i d rather they had included something more useful such as rechargeable batteries and a recharger  speaking of which you don t get any rechargeable batteries but since it can use aa s this is no big problem  you don t get a case either  and buying a small 3rd party case can be difficult because of the depth of the camera  it uses smartmedia memory which i don t like because it s flimsy  slow  and more expensive than compactflash  the lens cap  a source of complaints with many cameras  is a pain because i keep forgetting to take it off before switching it on  it should also be tied to the body of the camera  so it s going to get lost sooner or later and probably sooner  this could have been easily rectified and is thus an unforgivable in my score sheet  another niggle i have is that it can only output to ntsc or pal depending on where you buy it  other brands  such as kodak  can output to both what you are buying here is a camera with little in the way of extras   but what a camera  ,camera weeks stun quality photo take compare today play many settings manual override yet auto mode take superb photo pull box put batteries start snap low light performance much better lesser camera remote control homme sure nice rather include something useful rechargeable batteries recharger speak get rechargeable batteries since use big problem get case either buy small rd party case difficult depth camera use smartmedia memory like fly slow expensive compactflash lens cap source complaints many camera pain keep forget take twitch also tie body camera go get lose sooner later probably sooner could easily rectify thus unforgivable score sheet another single output pal depend buy band today output buy camera little way extra camera
386,camera, here is my update i promised you  referring to my initial review titled  first impression wow  while reading this review keep in mind my saga with digital cameras  which started around christmas time  here is a quick refresher  with a new baby in the family i thought it would be nice to get mom a digital camera for christmas  not knowing much about digital cameras i spent 2 weeks going from store to store getting sales reps  opinions on cameras  the first camera i settled on was the 2 3 mega pixel toshiba pdr m60  see my review on the toshiba pdr m60  the toshiba took excellent pictures but the camera casing felt cheap  basically giving you the  i m gonna break when the warranty is up feeling  the toshiba also used aa batteries which when taking pictures on high resolution lasts about 50 60 pics  even less with the screen on  i then traded the toshiba in for a 1 3 mega pixel sony dsc s30  the s30 came with a rechargeable battery and had a durable case  overall i liked the s30 but the pictures  especially in doors and in low light  were not as crisps and clear as the toshiba  in hopes of gaining better picture quality  plus the ability to take minute long videos  i returned the s30 and ordered the s50 from an online retailer  but that is another story all together  after my first weekend with the s50 i was impressed and left my first review titles  first impression wow  this is an update on that review the sony dsc s50 is a great all around camera  keep in mind the toshiba and the sony dsc s30 both cost  400  however the dsc s50 costs around  600  as far as durability and features you can not go wrong with the sony  the rechargeable battery is the best  it really does last  i have taken almost 200 pics and 15 videos and still have 100 minutes of battery life left  the battery even recharges while still in the camera  while others have complained about sony s flip screen monitor and the lack of a viewfinder  claiming that in bright conditions the screen is hard to see  i have not run into this yet and we have had some really sunny days in florida  i also like how the buttons on the back of the camera are laid out  they allow for easy access while taking pictures or videos  the camera comes with plenty of features  too many to list  however the ability to record 1 minute long videos is great  while they are not the best quality they are perfect for email  grandma cried when she saw her granddaughter eat cereal for the first time in a video i was able to send within minutes of the actual event  i do have one low point to the camera  we buy cameras to take pictures and the sony s50 takes good pictures  however they are not excellent  if only the sony s50 had the optics the toshiba pdr m60 has  the s50 takes the same quality image as the s30  simply put if you are looking for excellent quality images with clear resolution and bright vivid colors save  200 and buy the toshiba pdr m60  if the toshiba had a better case or a rechargeable battery i would still own it  however is you are a gadget person who loves toys the dsc s50 is the camera for you  ,update promise refer initial review title first impression read review keep mind sage digital camera start around christmas time quick refresh new baby family think would nice get mon digital camera christmas know much digital camera spend weeks go store store get sales rep opinions camera first camera settle meg fix toshiba per see review toshiba per toshiba take excellent picture camera cause felt cheap basically give donna break warranty feel toshiba also use batteries take picture high resolution last pick even less screen trade toshiba meg fix sonya duc come rechargeable battery unable case overall like picture especially doors low light crisis clear toshiba hop gain better picture quality plus ability take minute long video return order online retailer another story together first weekend impress leave first review title first impression update review sonya duc great around camera keep mind toshiba sonya duc cost however duc cost around far disability feature go wrong sonya rechargeable battery best really last take almost pick video still minutes battery life leave battery even charge still camera others complain sonya lip screen monitor lack viewfinder claim bright condition screen hard see run yet really sunny days florida also like button back camera lay allow easy access take picture video camera come plenty feature many list however ability record minute long video great best quality perfect email grand cry saw granddaughter eat cereal first time video able send within minutes actual event one low point camera buy camera take picture sonya take good picture however excellent sonya optic toshiba per take quality image simply put look excellent quality image clear resolution bright vivid color save buy toshiba per toshiba better case rechargeable battery would still however cadet person love toy duc camera
387,camera, when shopping for a digital camera  you probably want the most for your dollar right  who doesn t  after doing exstensive research on cameras  finding this one was a blessing  while i could state a bunch of specs and fill this space with technical stuff  i m sure you can go to the toshiba com web site for yourself  i wanted a camera that had would give me clear still pictures and short movies  having never used a digital camera before  i wanted one that was really easy to use  this one is menu driven  in short  i needed a camera that is simple enough to learn on  yet will allow me to take really awsome pictures if i ever get better at photography it s a simple camera in some resects  you can use it to just point and shoot  no worries about focusing though  it does that for you  you can set the flash to one spot and just leave it there  at this level  it basically acts kind of like a regular film camera here s where it gets better you can set your flash to different levels to accomidate for stuff like low light   red eye reduction there are different modes that help you get the best pictures possible  while taking pictures of my toddler i found the burst mode to be incredibly helpful  it takes a series of pictures in quick sucession  good for moving subjects and if you ve ever tried to get a toddler to sit still for a picture you can see how handy this is  if you get really good  there s a manual mode so you can mess around with settings drawbacks unfortunatly there is quite a delay from when you push the button to when the camera actually takes the picture  while annoying  it s easily worked around  low lighting makes it almost impossible to shoot using your lcd screen  movie mode  you can do it in low light but your movie might suck  the battery has a decent life  being rechargable is good  yet bad  if you re out some where and your battery dies  unless you have another one or use your adapter  you re out of luck  on the plus side  we all know how expensive it can get when you have to buy batteries all the time  what i got with my camera with my camera i recived a 8 meg  smart media  card  a lens cap  a carry strap  and software  the software is really cool and makes getting your pics easy  you just  get images  extras i did buy a lcd screen protector  after a few uses i found that my thumb always seems to end up on the screen  not wanting to dirty or scratch my screen i got a proctector that i can replace if i have to  i also bought a camera bag for it since the thought of haveing my investment floating around wasn t appealing  screen protector  about  10 off ebay  camera bag i think was  20 or so off the toshiba web site  i also bought another media card  i got a 32 meg card and it didn t cost more than what i would have spent in a month for film and developing picture stuff  i keep my camera set to take 800x600 pics  that s  medium  size  i have it set at medium quiality  this allows me to take a good amount of pics and not have them look crummy 800x600 is what most people have thier computer screen resoultion set at  macro setting can get you very close  i was able to take some neat pics of the inside of a flower without it getting blurry  overall  i think the pictures are crispy looking and far better than my 35mm film camera more extras there s a ton of other stuff you can buy to add to your camera  do you really like the  floppy disk  idea  you can get a floppy that you plug your media into and get your pics that way  you can get tripods  lenses  bags  faster rechargers  bigger media cards  there s no shortage of accesories to buy if you want more add ons durability  well  i don t know about that as i ve never dropped my camera  i really don t think it would withstand a lot of abuse though  my little brother had a very expensive untill he dropped it about 4 feet  now he has a very exspenive paper weight  as long as you hold on to your camera for dear life and don t drop it  i think it ll last for a long time overall i think it s a great camera  it s few drawbacks are easily worked around  i bought my camera as a refurbished model from the toshiba web site  the price was definetly right  it has a lot of options and quality for the price tag  ,shop digital camera probably want dollar right extensive research camera find one bless could state bunch speck fill space technical stuff sure go toshiba com web site want camera would give clear still picture short move never use digital camera want one really easy use one menu drive short need camera simple enough learn yet allow take really picture ever get better photography simple camera respect use point shoot worry rouse though set flash one spot leave level basically act kind like regular film camera get better set flash different level accommodate stuff like low light red eye reduction different modes help get best picture possible take picture toller find burst mode incredibly helpful take series picture quick secession good move subject ever try get toller sit still picture see handy get really good manual mode mess around settings drawback unfortunately quite delay push button camera

388,camera, when i was in the market for a digital camera  two years ago now  i had researched a lot of different cameras  but the kodak dc 215 stood out among the competition with its then excellent features and an overall great deal  two years later  i am still a  semi happy dc215 owner  but if you re thinking about getting this camera now  think again  why  you may ask  because at this point  this camera s features are outdated  and it is almost obsolete  want the details kodak dc215 features a 1 megapixel ccd with a 2x optical zoom  while this was more than enough then  today s cameras far outgrow those specifications  but  if you aren t looking for that kind of precision  you may be satisfied by this camera the zoom worked great  until i had a little accident with the camera  hit the lens against a table  not too hard  but enough to offset the focus for good there are some major shortcomings about the quality of pictures in this camera  for example  action shots  any movement  shows up as a smear in the picture  also  do not try to take any pictures at night of anything further than 6 feet from the camera  you just won t see anything the connection to the computer is through a serial cable  and with the size of the pictures  it takes forever to link up to the camera and download the pictures  you d be better off purchasing a compactflash card reader  and use the usb connection the battery life of this camera is non existent  if you use the lcd screen to preview review your pictures  if so  expect about 5 minutes runtime from the 4 aa batteries that go into this thing  however  if you don t use the screen  you can get a decent amount of pictures taken without problems these are by far not all of the pros cons of the camera  just the ones that are the most obvious to me as a 2 year owner of the unit  i have to say that i ve taken tons of good pictures with it  but being a scrutinizing gadget person  i m annoyed with this camera s shortcomings  and looking to get something better down the road if you find that this camera will do  buy it  but if you want fast downloads  long battery life  and high quality pictures  stay away from this one  ,market digital camera two years ago research lot different camera today stand among competition excellent feature overall great deal two years later still semi happy owner think get camera think may ask point camera feature outdated almost obsolete want detail today feature megapixel cod optical room enough today camera far outgrowth specification look kind precision may satisfy camera room work great little accident camera hit lens table hard enough offset focus good major shortcomings quality picture camera example action shots movement show smear picture also try take picture night anything feet camera see anything connection computer aerial cable size picture take forever link camera download picture better purchase compactflash card reader use us connection battery life camera non extent use lead screen review picture expect minutes auntie batteries go thing however use screen get decent amount picture take without problems far pro sons camera ones obvious year owner unit say take tons good picture scrutinize cadet person annoy camera shortcomings look get something better road find camera buy want fast download long battery life high quality picture stay away one

392,auto, saab 9 5 2 3l stick i must confess  one of the main reasons i ended up buying the saab over a 328 was because the dealer cut me an insane deal on the 99 s going out  while it is  not  as sporty as i would want it to be  i would still call it a great car if you cannot afford a 540i or a a6 2 7 turbo  handles better than it feels  does give you an indication of body roll  highway cruising is great  the car is rock stable even at speeds  gt  120 mph  pickup in the 0 60 department could be better  but passing feels better than most cars i have driven including sports cars  possible due to the full of torque available in the 1800 to 4000 rpm range  anyone  who is sick of seeing tiny bmws 3 series are sub compacts  and acura tls getting stuffed into their parking lot neighbourhood should get a 9 5  be different  some say the saab has a higher snob factor than a bimmer  if that does anything for you i also find it a better drive than the 9 3s i test drove  my other car is a honda prelude sh vtec screamer  so i had high expectations while looking for a sedan  things i don t like  hate the gear shift  and the slight body roll  i beleive the roll is a cheap fix and it is easy to boost the turbo to get me north of 200 hp out of this  though i am not sure i will need it i have currently leased it  and am tempted to buy if off  oh yes  i have a base with all the se options  leather  sunroof  seats etc except the harmon kardon stereo  get that  the base stereo is not that great     ,scab stick must confess one main reason end buy scab dealer cut insane deal go sport would want would still call great car afford turn candle better feel give indication body roll highway bruise great car rock stable even speed may pick department could better pass feel better cars drive include sport cars possible due full true available rum range anyone sick see tiny bow series sub compact acute tis get stuff park lot neighbourhood get different say scab higher snow factor summer anything also find better drive test drive car hand prelude ten scream high expectations look sedan things like hate gear shift slight body roll believe roll cheap fix easy boost turn get north though sure need currently lease tempt buy oh yes base se option leather sunroof seat etc except harmony pardon sterno get base sterno great

395,camera, this was my first digital camera  purchased in august 1999  it hooked me on the digital camera concept  but not on this camera in particular this model is easy to use  point and click  on board review is nice  and you can delete photos right at the camera if the shot is no good  the memory that comes with the camera holds 64 photos easily that are good enough for viewing in the internet  or about 8 high quality prints  some fun features include built in frames and date printing the downfall of this camera is the print resolution  you can t even print even the better quality photos at bigger than 4 by 6 inches  i upload a lot of my pictures to ofoto com to have real prints made of them  and the biggest you can get uploads to come out clear there is 3 by 5 from this camera connection is slow and i had trouble with the camera disconnecting after a certain number of transferred pictures  the adobe software that accompanies the camera is easy to learn  but takes up quite a bit of drive space while in use   don t plan on playing a game in the background while you are cropping and editing pictures  a card reader  sold for about  30 seperately  is a smart investment  makes for faster upload this is a good starter camera  very easy to use  my six year old son took good pictures with this model  i put about 1000 pictures on this camera  it keeps count of how many times the camera has been used  mostly for things i sell on ebay  and this camera is perfect for that  camera is sturdy  i dropped it a few times  oops  on tile floor and the worst thing that ever happened was the batteries popped out get recharging batteries  this camera eats them in about 60 pictures   takes 4 aa br br  ,first digital camera purchase august hook digital camera concept camera particular model easy use point click board review nice delete photo right camera shoot good memory come camera hold photo easily good enough view internet high quality print fun feature include build frame date print downfall camera print resolution even print even better quality photo bigger inch unload lot picture foot com real print make biggest get uplands come clear camera connection slow trouble camera disconcert certain number transfer picture adore software accompany camera easy learn take quite bite drive space use plan play game background drop edit picture card reader sell separately smart investment make faster unload good start camera easy use six year old son take good picture model put picture camera keep count many time camera use mostly things sell bay camera perfect camera sturdy drop time loop tile floor worst thing ever happen batteries pop get charge batteries camera eat picture take br
396,camera, this is my first digital camera what sold me was the features  i liked the fact that the camera uses regular aa batteries  not a pricey proprietary battery like some cameras do  so in a pinch you can find batteries anywhere you can buy rechargeable nickel metal hydride  don t use nicads  batteries and a charger inexpensively at radio shack  i also like the fact the camera uses compact flash memory cards  again  widely available  this camera can use up to a 128 meg card some cameras only have internal memory  which means when you fill up the memory  you can t take any more pictures until you download them to your computer and erase them from the camera s memory it also has a 3x optical zoom  a digital only zoom basically just crops the picture  so the resolution suffers  the camera also has a lot of settings that can be defined by the user  flash  white balance  power settings  etc  it s got a lot of options but better have your manual handy until you get familiar with them all it also comes with a usb cable so you can download the photos to your computer  and the canon software is pretty decent  i thought that a 1 3 megapixel camera would not produce quality photos  but i was pleasantly surprised  at the highest resolution setting  this camera takes excellent  sharp pictures  a friend of mine recently enlarged several of my shots to 8x10  and printed them out on his printer at work on photo paper the results were amazing i had always read that you couldn t enlarge pictures taken with a 1 3 megapixel camera beyond 4x6  and even that was stretching it don t believe it the 8x10 s he made were sharper than the 4x6 prints i usually get using 400 asa film this camera will take pictures in near total darkness  but shots taken in poor light will tend to be somewhat grainy however  the quality of pictures taken in decent light is impressive  the results are crisp  clear  well exposed and have nicely saturated colors  the battery life is about average  and there is a fair amount of parallax error when you are using the viewfinder instead of the lcd  the lcd can be hard to see in bright light  also if you are looking for your first digital camera  you absolutely cannot go wrong with one of these  it s loaded with features and won t cost an arm and a leg canon has discontinued this model  and they can be had cheap  if you can find one i love this camera  ,first digital camera sell feature like fact camera use regular batteries price proprietary battery like camera pinch find batteries anywhere buy rechargeable nickel metal hydrate use ricans batteries charge inexpensively radio shock also like fact camera use compact flash memory card widely available camera use meg card camera internal memory mean fill memory take picture download computer ease camera memory also optical room digital room basically crop picture resolution suffer camera also lot settings define user flash white balance power settings etc get lot option better manual handy get familiar also come us cable download photo computer canon software pretty decent think megapixel camera would produce quality photo pleasantly surprise highest resolution set camera take excellent sharp picture friend mine recently enlarge several shots print printer work photo paper result amaze always read enlarge picture take megapixel camera beyond even stretch believe make sharper print usually get use film camera take picture near total darkness shots take poor light tend somewhat grain however quality picture take decent light impressive result crisp clear well expose nicely saturate color battery life average fair amount parallel error use viewfinder instead lead lead hard see bright light also look first digital camera absolutely go wrong one load feature cost arm leg canon discontinue model cheap find one love camera
397,camera, first off  the picture associated with this camera on epinions com is not a picture of the vivitar 3745  for an actual picture of the 3745  go to vivitar com  i researched this camera and couldn t find any reviews  but it had all of the options that i was looking for so i figured that for the price  it would be a good deal   i was wrong  i purchased this camera on walmart com  for  229 i got both the vivitar 3745  a 3 1 mega pixel camera  and a free 128 mb sd card  delivery was cheap and fast   i ordered on a thursday night and received it the following tuesday morning  the cost of 2 day shipping was less than  5  this was my first digital camera and i was looking for something to supplement my 5 year old automatic canon 35mm camera  i m not a photography expert  so i just wanted something that was simple to use and took pictures that would be somewhat comparable to my canon 35mm   for the last 4 years i have been paying to have all of my 35mm pictures put on disks when i get them developed  my goal with going to a digital camera was to save money on developing by putting the pictures on a disk myself and only having the best pictures printed included in the package were digital photo editing software  the camera  a camera case  a lens cap  a wrist strap  a cord to connect the camera to your pc via a usb port  a cord to connect the camera to your tv via a rca connection  and 4 aa alkaline batteries  the 128 mb sd card  which i believe was a walmart com exclusive deal  shipped separately  but arrived on the same day when you first turn on the camera  you have to enter the date and time  which was easy to do  but unfortunately  this had to be done every time that you changed the batteries  and i had to change the batteries often  the menus on the camera were easy to use and i liked the fact that in addition to the picture preview lcd screen on the back of the camera  the top of the camera had a small screen which displayed the image resolution  the number of remaining pictures that could be taken at that resolution  and the remaining battery life  if the indicator was correct  you could take around 140 pictures at the highest quality resolution on a 128 mb card  in addition to taking still photos  the camera also allows you to take video without sound in the quicktime format  a 128 mb sd card will hold about five and a half minutes worth of video  i  owned  this camera for a week and took about 150 different still pictures in various settings  inside  outside  and in various lighting  and about 12 different short videos  all of the still pictures  regardless of the lighting  were dark and pixelated looking  the videos were somewhat pixelated  but they seemed to be of better quality than the still pictures   i expected a degree of pixelization on the videos  after all  this is a still camera and the ability to shoot video is a nice bonus  but not the real purpose of the camera  when my first few pictures came out somewhat pixelated  i thought that maybe i was using the wrong image resolution setting  but that wasn 146t the case and no matter which image resolution setting i used  my pictures were dark and pixelated  the camera 146s built in flash didn t seem to make any difference in the picture quality  i took a number of pictures at night in my living room  a room that is around 15 x 20 feet  regardless of whether the flash was used or not  my pictures were dark and pixelated  i thought that maybe the pictures would be better once i downloaded them onto my pc  i hooked the camera up to my pc via a usb port  downloading pictures from the camera to the pc was quick and didn t require any special software  my operating system is windows me  but the picture quality only appeared worse on my pc  the included photo editing software was adequate  very similar to most of the other photo editing software out there  but nothing to get excited about  i tried editing and improving my photos using the included software  microsoft picture it  and kodak easyshare  no matter which program i used  my pictures were dark and pixelated and nothing seemed to improve them  hooking the camera up to my 32 inch tv 146s rca connector in order to view pictures on the tv was easy to accomplish  but something seemed to cause interference and in addition to being dark and pixelated  the pictures when viewed on the tv also looked  147fuzzy 148 and would fade in and out the 4 aa alkaline batteries that came with the camera lasted about 20 pictures  i changed to rechargeable ni mh batteries and could take about 30 pictures prior to having to change batteries  and thus having to re enter the date and time with each battery change  the shutter button was very unresponsive at times  i sometimes had trouble knowing whether or not i had taken a picture and had to stop and use the review function in order to see if i had gotten the shot  when taking video  you use the shutter button to start and stop the video  but sometimes i had to push the button 5 or 6 times before i could get it to start or stop the video  other times the camera would lock up when switching between video and still picture modes and the only way i could get the camera to work again was to take out the batteries  and then i had to re enter the date and time  after a week i had had enough and took the camera back to my local wal mart  i was out the shipping cost  less than  5  but i learned an important lesson about buying a cheap camera  you usually get what you pay for  this time i bought a kodak 6340 for  279 and so far  i couldn t be happier with it  the sad thing about the vivitar 3745 is that i really liked the layout of the camera  the functions were very intuitive  less than a minute after taking it out of the box  i was taking pictures and i quickly figured out the majority of the functions before opening the manual latter that night  unfortunately  all of the pictures that i took using the vivitar 3745 weren t very good and nothing i did seemed to improve their quality  i had to sit down and read the instruction manual before i felt comfortable using my new kodak 6340  which only took about half an hour to read cover to cover  the kodak doesn t have as many manual settings as the vivitar  but every picture that i ve taken with it so far is excellent and i ve already taken about 100

404,camera, this is the first digital camera i ve owned  i ve briefly used friends  in the past and learned how wonderful these things are  so this year i finally got one as a present  nonetheless  i m not exactly an electronic guru  i just know the simple facts  as an average user b power b  so i get an awesome digital camera as a gift  and what do i do  take it out of the box and begin snapping away  no  the sony dsc 171 uses 2 aa rechargeable nickel metal hydride batteries  which are included  with a recharger  and it takes up to 13 hours to charge them  note  the manual specifies that the sony dsc 171 cannot be used with regular aa alkaline batteries  so unless you also bought the ac adapter  or happen to have some fully charged nickel metal hydride aa batteries handy  you have to wait about 13 hours while the batteries charge before you can use your camera  but i do like the fact that the camera comes with a recharger  the camera can also be used with an ac power adapter  but that is not included and must be purchased separately  the manual suggests that you use the ac adapter when downloading your photos or printing them  so the camera does not shut off in the middle of the process   fyi  i didn t get one  and when the camera runs out of batteries  it shuts off without retracting and closing the lens   and you can t retract or close the lens until you replace the batteries  so be sure to turn your camera off as soon as you get the low battery warning  or else you could be stuck with your lens open and sticking out  which can be inconvenient   memory    the pictures you take are stored on a teeny little thing called a memory stick  which is shorter than a stick of gum  the camera comes with a 16mb memory stick  which stores about  96 of 640x480 pictures 16 of 1600x1200 pictures 10 of 2048x1536 pictures  not a comprehensive list  but just to give you an idea   i eventually bought another memory stick  128mb  which cost about  80 00   looking at your pictures    to get the pictures from your camera onto your computer  so you can e mail or print them  you can use the video out port and the included usb cable  before you do this  you need to install a usb driver  which is on the enclosed cd rom   this is quite easy  and should take just a few minutes   if you have a sony computer  you can also just remove the memory stick and pop it right into your computer  you can also look at your pictures on a television with the included rca video cable  instant slide show of your vacation pictures anywhere there is a television   picture quality    the sony dsc 171 has a resolution of 3 2 megapixels  i m not sure exactly what this means  but it appears that the more megapixels you have  the better your picture quality  without much experience with other digital cameras  all i can say is that my pictures look really great  when i print them on photo paper using my ink jet printer  they look almost as good as a 35mm print to me   great colors and crisp images  i did have a chance to compare my sony photos with the photos i took with the polaroid pdc 640  which has less than 1 megapixel   and what a world of difference   zoom    the sony dsc 171 has an optical zoom of 3x and and digital zoom of 2x  for total zoom power of 6x  i think the 160mm zoom on my 35mm camera was a little more powerful  but the 6x zoom on the sony dsc 171 is just fine for what i need   design   ease of use    the camera is a good  compact size  and fits nicely in my hand  and all the controls  like the mode dial  the control button  and the zoom button  are well placed and comfortable to use  i also had no trouble with the menu  or the other functions of the sony dsc 171  after just a few minutes with the manual  it was easy to figure out how to do everything i wanted  i was able to begin using the camera right away  once the batteries were charged  that is  so this camera is easy to use  even for a newbie like me   movie    i was surprised to discover that you can record little movies with the sony dsc 171  which you can download as mpeg files onto your computer  there is no sound  and the picture quality isn t great  so it s hardly a substitute for a camcorder  and nothing more than a fun little gimmick  but it s handy if you ever want to send a little digital footage via e mail   misc    aside from the initial cost of the camera  i expect that most people will want to invest in some accessories to enhance their use of the camera  memory stick  128mb    about  80 90 each extra ni mh batteries   about  6 8 for a package of 2 case  model lcs cp2    about  20 from sonystyle com ac adapter   about  40 from sonystyle com all in all  i m really happy with the sony dsc 171  this will be a great  convenient way to keep and share

410,camera, i ve been using this camera for an year and hence my comments are not from the first look  but from usage of several months if you are looking for a camera which has the best dollar per pixel value  then this is the winner but  if you are looking for convenience  durability  good quality pictures for all light conditions  keep away from this takes good pictures in daylight  but one has to work hard to get a non shaken picture in poor light conditions battery life is about average  the good part is that it runs on regular aa batteries  so you can get them anywhere  but  the bad part is that you have to carry lots of them with you when you go on a trip  i am not sure if this has a charger inside  but the camera did not come with any ac adapter  there is a  dc in  socket on the camera  which means there would be an optional ac adapter from kodak to use with this camera for an extra price  but i am not sure if that can charge the batteries  if we use rechargeable aa batteries the size of the camera is big for its features  come on  kodak designers  what were you thinking  digital cameras don t need a film compartment  a motor to advance rewind the film  all they need is circuitry to record data onto a memory card  an lcd screen  and a flash and that s it  the size could be much smaller on this  with the camera being light weight and big in size  you get a plastic hollow feeling when you carry this camera  even with this big size of the camera  the battery compartment is very tight  it is barely bigger than the size of the batteries  as a result  the tension on the spring is very high causing an overload on the small plastic cover that holds the batteries  my battery compartment broke with first month of its use  i now use duck tape to cover my compartment  i am not alone in this area  my brother who has the same camera has broken battery compartment too camera features are very well decided in the design  cut down all the non sense and give only required to an average user  can take pictures in two different resolution settings on to in built memory or to an external compact flash memory  i used an 64mb external memory to take more than 300 pictures during one of my vacation on this camera  it takes little while to record the picture after you release the shutter  but i think it has more to do with the speed of the memory than the camera itself  i used a cheaper memory and hence it might be of less speed  it has an in built flash  not very powerful but of average power the interface software which downloads the pictures into your pc was simple to use and easy to understand  it has some bugs though  in my windows xp  i cannot download to the same folder all the time  i have to let it create a new folder everytime i download pictures i would have liked a usb interface or a firewire interface  serial port is too slow  i had to wait for considerable amount of time  before the pictures are downloaded to my pc it does not an optical zoom  eliminating the need of a motor here and another question on why that big size  it has a video out  cable has to be purchased extra  to connect to a vcr and record the video no audio i would only recommend this if you want a digital camera for a bargain price  ,use camera year hence comment first look usage several months look camera best dollar per fix value winner look convenience disability good quality picture light condition keep away take good picture daylight one work hard get non shake picture poor light condition battery life average good part run regular batteries get anywhere bad part carry lot go trip sure charge inside camera come ac adapt socket camera mean would optional ac adapt today use camera extra price sure charge batteries use rechargeable

smaller camera light weight big size get plastic hollow feel carry camera even big size camera battery compartment tight barely bigger size batteries result tension spring high cause overcoat small plastic cover hold batteries battery compartment break first month use use duck tape cover compartment alone area brother camera break battery compartment camera feature well decide design cut non

411,camera, first of all i just have to say before purchasing this wonderful camera  i read the reviews that people posted on this page  i wanted to see what was the overall opinion of this camera  many have complained saying that is gives them problems  but after reading what the problems were  i had realized that it wasnt the actual camera  but other things that had caused the problems i bought the camera  and i must say i have never been more pleased  i used to own am agfa cl30 clik  and wasn t pleased at all  so that is why i decided a change  the main reason i need a digital camera is because i take pictures for a website  mainly  the pictures are of parties  in the dark  during the night  i needed a camera that takes great quality pictures  even in the night time  the pdr m60 was exactly what i was looking for  i read reviews where people have complained that the camera has a  low flash  which is completely untrue  this camera has different flash settings  including a night feature  which takes bright and clear pictures even in low light  another great thing that i have noticed is that you can take black and white pictures  this makes it more fun and interesting to explore the different picture styles  i already took a b w photo of my puppy  and let me tell you its the cutest picture ever the camera itself is pretty small  its easy to hold  and comes with a neck strap  i wish it had came with an ac adapter  but those can be purchased for like  12 at radioshack so its not a problem i have seen that many have complained about the usb cable and said that it doesnt work  mine works just fine  i just think something is wrong with those peoples  usb ports on their computer  and that is why they have problems with it  i have already transfered many pics onto my computer and the usb cable works just fine  pictures get transfered very quickly too the camera should have a soft case just to protect the lcd  the is probably the only complaint i have other than the ac adapter  i bought a 64mb smartmedia card for  33 00 online  so i didnt really mind the fact that the camera came with a 4mb card i have a nihm rechargable battery pack that i have used from my other camera  and i suggest using something like that just so you can have enough battery  i take pictures all night long at parties  and i need enough battery to handle the all night usage i really recommend this camera  you wont be disappointed  after you have it for a while  make sure you play around with the different settings that it has to be sure that it works the way you want it  this camera can also be upgraded  you just go online and upgrade it yourself  i am glad i had purchased it  and for the price i got it for  i think it was more than worth it  ,first say purchase wonderful camera read review people post page want see overall opinion camera many complain say give problems read problems realize want actual camera things cause problems buy camera must say never please use agra click please decide change main reason need digital camera take picture webster mainly picture party dark night need camera take great quality picture even night time per exactly look read review people complain camera low flash completely untrue camera different flash settings include night feature take bright clear picture even low light another great thing notice take black white picture make fun interest explore different picture style already take photo puppy let tell chest picture ever camera pretty small easy hold come neck strap wish come ac adapt purchase like radioshack problem see many complain us cable say work mine work fine think something wrong people us port computer problems already transfer many pick onto computer us cable work fine picture get transfer quickly camera soft case protect lead probably complaint ac adapt buy mb smartmedia card online really mind fact camera come mb card rechargable battery pack use camera suggest use something like enough battery take picture night long party need enough battery handle night usage really recommend camera wont disappoint make sure play around different settings sure work way want camera also upgrade go online upgrade glad purchase price get think worth
412,camera, so you think that you want to buy a digital camera  well have i got news for you  these things are not at all as easy as they look  i thought that all i would have to do is buy one of these cameras and take some pictures and in a dew minutes i would have pictures to send everyone through email  that is not at all the case i went out and bought myself a nice digital camera that was not a lot of money but yet cost a pretty good penny  when i got home i sat down and read the manual that was only about four hundred pages long and only took me all day to read  then i thought that i had it but this was only the start  once i took a picture which only took me about an hour to figure out how to do i tried to down load it to my computer  this was one of the hardest things i have ever tried to do which is probably because i am not too good on the computer any ways  after awhile i finally figured it all out i think that this probably is one of the best digital cameras because it has a great picture that comes out and is very clear  i guess that i made a good choice when i bought this camera for my needs but feel that i should have just kept my money if i had to tell a friend if they should buy a digital camera i think i would have to have them over and try to use mine and see if they would be able to handle one br br  ,think want buy digital camera well get news things easy look think would buy one camera take picture dew minutes would picture send everyone email case go buy nice digital camera lot money yet cost pretty good penny get home sit read manual four hundred page long take day read think start take picture take hour figure try load computer one hardest things ever try probably good computer ways awhile finally figure think probably one best digital camera great picture come clear guess make good choice buy camera need feel keep money tell friend buy digital camera think would try use mine see would able handle one br
413,auto,  hi  this is ron ravetti the internet manager at big valley ford  i have read your synopsis  it sure appears you have done quite a bit of research on the supercrew  true  it is quite a unique vehicle  however  as to saturn s new suv coming out i remain quite sure they will not hold a candle to the supercrew  rather it will compete with our escape  when properly equipped the escape will tow 3500lbs  i believe the escape to be a well needed vehicle to the suv line up  at a good price  have you checked one out  wish to  please feel free to contact me   one more thing  big valley has formed a  business direct  dept to better facilitate your effort to enjoy a hassle free  relaxed buying experience with priority pricing b  you can see our  team   3 of us  in our ad contained in today s asparagus fest insert within the record  pictures and all  or  read yet another mention of this new department in the 4 13 auto section  again  thank you for your comments  ron ravetti internet mgr business direct dept big valley ford  dear mr  ravetti i don t consider being badgered by four different salespeople after informing three of them that we are being helped by the first salesperson that approached us hassle free and relaxing  in fact we were so relaxed that we walked off of your lot with out purchasing  maybe your hassle free buying experience could use a bit of adjustment thank you for your letter and yes i did do a good job researching the super crew  by the time i write a review i have known the vehicle very intimately when salespeople work on commission a bit of ethics is very important  no sale s lot i have ever been on ignored sales ethics on commission sales  your sales people need to respect when told  we already are working with a sales person but thank you anyway  we were hassled right off the lot follow up letter from mr  ravetti george handles most of my personal correspondence   george  thanks for your reply  what i meant by hassle free is dealing with this specific department  business direct internet dept  your experience would be different  my team  3 of us  do not work the lot  rather we are the fleet dept selling to internet

home from  wouldn t it be a bit wiser to properly train the sales people that have first contact with your customers a bit of a different beginning to a review but i thought the response to my last review was rather interesting  we had not received a hassle free buying experience at the ford lot at the stockton auto mall in stockton california  in fact it is was the worst experience we had ever had  when we first arrived at the ford lot a sales person approached us by the name of hector  hector answered all the questions we needed answering  we informed him when we needed him we would find him and to let us be while we were looking and comparing  he was very polite and agreed to let us alone for a while  while we were looking at different vehicles at least three other salespeople approached  we informed each and everyone that we already had a salesperson  i can see the competition between salespeople and why they approached us  but i can t see why they couldn t respect a thank you and leave it at that  at least i am glad they appreciate hector  the only polite helpful salesperson we found on the lot  enough of this let us get on with the review 2001 ford windstar limited edition i think this would be a van i would feel comfortable having my family in  the windstar has many safety features such as a sensor system that provides the proper level of inflation for the dual stage driver and passenger airbags  the limited edition windstar has side impact airbags for both the passenger and driver  these sensors determine just how much energy should be used to deploy the airbags according to the severity of the accident  another standard safety feature is the abs tire warning system that alerts when the tire pressure is low  one of the optional features is the all speed traction control that helps maintain traction on slippery roads  how about the power heated signal mirrors that contain a lighted arrow that alerts traffic behind to you lane changes  these also flash when the sliding door is open  people behind you know that someone is leaving the vehicle  the first i have ever seen is a conversation mirror that is on the overhead console that allows you to see the kids in the back seat with out your attention leaving the road  foot pedals that move  i guess one auto dealer realized were not all the same height  the brake and accelerator pedals move  the driver can position them at their own comfort level  wouldn t that be nice not having to move the seats each time another driver takes over  maybe the best safety feature is the lower anchors and tethers for children  latch the 2000 windstar achieved a five star government front crash test rating for the driver and front passenger ok what did i really love about this van  the entertainment system in the back seat  if that had been available when i had young children think of the gray hairs that would have never turned gray  pop in a video and the kids aren t nit picking each other  just  wow   auto vision family entertainment system  headliner mounted adjustable 6 4  color monitor removable video cassette player  stereo auido through vehicle speakers  two 12v powerpoints  2 headphones with 8  cords  infared remote control  sidepocket storage for video cassettes  rear seat control module with volume control  media selection  seek function  two headphone jacks that are compatible with popular video game systems i  cost for this wonderful piece of mind   995 00 just imagine the last two hundred miles of a long journey  the kids are tired  pop in their favorite video game and they will be happy for the last two hundred miles  the drive can put a soothing cd in and enjoy the remainder of the trip  the windstar has an am fm stereo and a 6 disc in dash cd changer with a clock my hot cup of fresh coffee will sit perfectly safe in the self adjustable cup holders  now i am forever chasing my hot cup of coffee across the dashboard and also catching it frequently on quick take offs the base price of this very useful and versatile vehicle is  33 570 adding the auto vision family entertainment system an additional  995 00 making the total price  35 220  the gas mileage is 18 in town and 24 highway  the fuel tank holds 26 gallons of fuel the windstar has 3 8l spi v6 engine and the 4 speed automatic transmission  on the highway there was plenty of power for passing  the front has a stabilizer bar and macpherson strut front suspension  there is a twist bean rear suspension  for a van it rolled into the turns nicely  the windstar had a solid feel to it the windstar was very easy for me to get up into  in fact of all the cars  trucks and vans we looked at that day the windstar were the easiest  i loved the side door  it opened so easily  it had a power slide door  it closed with just a touch of a finger  i remember so many times with my dodge caravan having an armful of stuff trying to get the darn door open  the power door is sensational  the limited edition windstar had 215 65r16 bsw self sealing tires and a full sized spare tire  the self sealing tires are a pretty neat feature  i remember playing with one of these at a tire shop one time  they had a board with 3 nails on it that levered into the tire  each time the puncture would seal immediately  i offended wondered how many punctures that tire ended up with when it was taken down as a demonstration and if it still held air this van will hold 7 people and still has plenty of additional storage space  the model we tried had bucket seats in the first and second row and a bench seat in the third row  the limited addition has many interior and exterior accents that sets off this vehicle rather nicely  to top all this off it has a keyless entry with a keypad the windstar comes standard with a class ii towing package and a 2 000 3 500 lbs  towing capacity  i believe this to be plenty adequate to tow a medium size boat  though i am a bit leery about the v6 engine and if it would have enough power to tow a medium size boat  i would just hate it if i were the person slowing down a long line of traffic on a mountain pass  it sure does aggravate me when i m at the back of a slow line  the limited edition windstar we are considering is a black with clear coat and mineral gray two tones  the 10 spoke brushed aluminum wheels set it off very nicely  the ford no deductible bumper to bumper 3 year or 36 000 mile warranty is accompnied with the 24 hour emergency roadside assistance program  i would have liked an option of a v8 engine  i really don t think the v6 will do everything we will require it to do  i like the functionality of the windstar  i especially like all the safety features  i always compare vehicles and their safety features by thinking to myself  would i use this automobile to bring a new baby home from the hospital  in the limited edition windstar i think i would be comfortable bringing a new baby home  i love the open road  i get very anxious after just a short period of time of not being on the open road  just set the wind behind me and i could go forever  that s exactly what i intend to do someday  is travel and see everything i can see until i finally get tired of going  ,hi ravetti internet manager big valley ford read sycosis sure appear do quite bite research supercrew true quite unique vehicle however return

414,camera, i m guessing you ve read a few other reviews already  and are no doubt familiar with the features and specs of this camera  so we ll deal with living with it  i originally purchased this camera around fifteen months ago as a gift for my wife  as she had taken a shine to my 1 3mp olympus d 150  while this camera was larger  it offered 2 1mp resolution  and more  non menu  controlled features  she loved this camera  and it gave birth to an interest in photography  which i have encouraged  and nourished by trading her up to a canon g2 this christmas  while i inherited the a20  and our daughter now has the d 150  in general photography  the results from this camera are more than adequate to satisfy the average amateur user  and only the limitations of it s available features prevent the more artistic use of an enthusiast  however  i must qualify this by stating that we do use powerful photo editing software at home  and can correct exposure problems  color casts  or composure prior to printing  this means that we can operate to a wider tolerance than some  if you intend to just use the shots  as is  you may  depending on your personal tastes  find the results mildly over exposed  around 1 2 stop  but this can be adjusted on the camera to suit yourself  never having used the software supplied with the camera  i can t comment on it  i use a digital camera primarily for work  i am an electrical engineer for a machine manufacturer  and am required to carry out field work to prove new designs  investigate possible design issues  and commissionings of modified proven products  this gives me a requirement for taking  technical photography  shots to expound upon what i have observed in the field  frequently these shots are taken internally to machinery  and under very poor lighting conditions  i frequently use the  macro  mode  and some are even taken  blind  with the camera at arms length even under these circumstances i can normally produce the evidence i need quickly and easily  at home  we use a card reader to download the images  and having done so since we ve had the camera  no one seem to know where it s cabling is now  so  when i recently had to produce some images quickly at work for a briefing a lack of proprietry cord let me down  had it been a standard usb  like olympus cameras  this would not have happened  i have since purchased a pc card adaptor for the cf card  so i can now load the images directly into my laptop  personally  i find the menu options less easy to use than the olympus version  but my wife views things the other way round  so i guess this is just a matter of personal taste and familiarity  like most digital cameras  especially when using the screen a lot  battery life was poor  then my friend told me about  photolife   energizer e  photo lithium  batteries  these are around twice the price of standard alkalines  but are designed for this use  and last fantastically well  i find myself changing batteries around every two months now  rather than about weekly as it was before  so now i have no complaints there  also  the supplied memory card is hopelessly inadequate  and was quickly replaced by a 64mb unit  as i only shoot with the minimum compression possible  this at least allows me to take a reasonable number of shots  65  as opposed to 7  as supplied  fortunately these are now reasonably priced  but when thinking of buying  factor in the price of additional memory in summary  much as though i hate to let the camera do the thinking for me  the nature of my usage requires it to be so  this camera has never let either my wife  or myself  down  continually producing results within the limits we operate with easily  ,guess read review already doubt familiar feature speck camera deal live originally purchase camera around fifteen months ago gift wife take shine polypus camera larger offer resolution non menu control feature love camera give birth interest photography encourage nourish trade canon christmas inherit daughter general photography result camera adequate satisfy average amateur user limitations available feature prevent artistic use

415,auto, i bought this car in feb 2000 used  with 15 000 miles on it  i needed a good reliable car for commuting  with excellent gas mileage  i did my homework  and finally decided on the neon  i ended up getting the plymouth neon  but it s identical to the dodge neon  i went for the 2 door since it s just me and my wife  and i liked the look of the 2 door  as well as the ability to open them up and be able to put large objects in the car  i ve moved a desk and a 6 foot high cat tree to day  takes some work  but it ll fit i haven t had a problem so far  2 years later and 30 000 miles  i regularly chain the oil  i had the brakes done once  and the tires replaced  but otherwise nothing  no mechanical problems what so ever  i ve been really impressed  and the car drives as well now as it did back at 15 000 miles  i ve read on a few dodge neon enthusiast sites that the car can start having problems around 60k  but alot of that has to do with how you drive it and care for it  i ve also talked to people with over 100k on their car with no problems  so take that for what it is worth right off the gas mileage is awesome  since i live in los angeles and commute about 60 miles round trip each day  i wanted something easy on gas  this car has been excellent  whenever i talk to others about gas mileage i always seem to get the best  the flip side of course is that the car is only a 4 cylinder  and doesn t accelerate as quick as i would like  but it s a trade off worth having  the interior is great  the back is a little less spacious  but again this doesn t affect me  the front is great  all controls are easy to use and clealy marked  the drink holders dont really work for larger beverages  but anything like a starbucks venti or smaller is fine  the back seats fold down  giving you access to the trunk from inside  there s not much more i can say  i could go into every detail  but your best bet is to go test ride one yourself  why cheat yourself when you can treat yourself  for the price  it s definately an amazing car  and i would buy another neon once mine gets high in miles  ,buy car feb use miles need good reliable car commute excellent gas mileage homework finally decide non end get plymouth non identical dodge non go door since wife like look door well ability open able put large object car move desk foot high cat tree day take work fit problem far years later miles regularly chain oil rake do tire replace otherwise nothing mechanical problems ever really impress car drive well back miles read dodge non enthusiast sit car start problems around clot drive care also talk people car problems take worth right gas mileage awesome since live los angeles commune miles round trip day want something easy gas car excellent whenever talk others gas mileage always seem get best lip side course car cylinder accelerate quick would like trade worth interior great back little less spacious affect front great control easy use clearly mark drink holders dont really work larger beverages anything like starbucks vent smaller fine back seat fold give access trunk inside much say could go every detail best bet go test ride one cheat treat price definitely amaze car would buy another non mine get high miles
416,auto, when i first got this car it was a wedding gift from my husband and it was a shock to me   of course i was in love with this car when he first brough it home to me because it was my first new car   i was driving a 1996 nissan maxima which i loved and had 140k   miles on it and still ran like it was brand new   but once i got the impalla ls and started driving it the first month it was great then i started having trouble with it   started out with small things and started getting larger  listed are dates and reasons that i had this car in the shop  please note i got this car in august of 1999  august 1999   drivers side electric window switch went out october 1999   had a new paint job on hood   top and trunk of car due to paint chipping off down to the metal and had new drivers side mirror put in because it could not hold up to the cold weather and cracked to pieces november 1999   sear warmer shorted outand caused motor to go out and new seat had to be put in because you cannot replace just the motor on the seat warmer you have to put in a new seat march 2000   seat warmer went out again   this time they just had to replace a wire  ciggerette lighter stoped working  console would not shut and plastic part under shifter broke in half when putting car in gear and the gear assembly for the power steering went out  may 2000   engine light stays on   had no power what so ever   cradle bolts came loose  june 2000   power steering rack once again came loose now let me elaborate on some of the problems and explain them a little furter   in october of 1999 i had to have the cars hood   top and trunk re painted because for some reason the paint starting just chipping off when you washed it or just rubbed it and it was down to the metal on the car  we took it into the dealer and of course they did not want to paint it and said that we got something on it   but my husband being the type of person he is that does not like to be accused of something that he did not do   fought with them about it and finally the man said bring it back on this day and the reginal manager will be here to make a decision about the car  so we went up there on that day and the man never showed up so they had to paint our car  they told us it would be about 5 days   and gave us a rent car well 5 days turned into one month   and then when i got the car back whoever buffed it out scratched the sides of the doors all up from the buttons on there jeans  so i had to once again take it back and have more work done on it to get those out   they never would tell us why the paint did that   so we got no explanation for that  as far as the seat warmers going out like they have and being repaired as many times as you can see above still to this day do not work   we just got fed up with them not being able to solve a simple problem like a seat warmer shorting out and gave up  the driver side works but the passenger seat does not work  the lighter would shoot sparks out when tryed to use  they said that it had a short in it and replaced it   the plate that is under the gear shift cracked in half when i put the car in gear   why i don t knwo they never would tell me   all they said is it got hung on something underneath and cracked it   they never want to tell you why something happened to your car when they know why  then i started having problems with the car front end popping when the brake was applied   well i only wrote down two times above that i took it to the shop but i took it more than that i just did not have the reciepts to actually see when i took it in   anyways   we took it to several places and they all said it was different things so naturally each time we took it to a new dealer they never fixed it   finally we took our chances and took it back to once last dealer in richardson texas that has outstanding ratings for fixing cars   and to our amazement they fixed it and even drove it around for 15 mintues to make sure it was fixed bfore they called us to come get it   and mind you this was the manager that did this to ensure we would not have the problem with them not fixing it as we did with everyone else  and last but not least i will describe things that i dont like about this car and things that i do like   first i dont like this car because it rides rough most of the time but it does have good days   and the least little bit of wind catches underneath and will whip you right off the road if you are not careful   the original tires that came on the car really were terrible   but i love this car because its roomy   sleak   had a great radio   the air works great and heater as well   the seats feel great when driving and sitting they seem to make you feel like can just slide right in with no problems and drive hundreds of miles without being uncomfortable  i like the fact that the seats come down in the back so that you have access to your trunk because this car has a huge trunk and its very deep and when something falls to the back you cannot reach it fron the outside of the car you have to pull down the seats to get to it   all the mirrors seem to be put in the right places and hights for shorter people like me   the fact that the seats can adjust to hight not just up and back is great  now that all the problems have been fixed in this car its great   i have not had any problems out of it since the last car dealer fixed it   i also got my car when they first came out   so i expected there to be problems with it being fresh on the market   ,first get car wed gift husband shock course love car first bring home first new car drive nissan maxim love miles still run like brand new get impalla start drive first month great start trouble start small things start get larger list date reason car shop please note get car august august drivers side electric window switch go october new paint job hood top trunk car due paint ship metal new drivers side

417,camera, i am not a professional photographer  not even an amateur  expert  but i do know a quality camera when i see one  much detail has been written about the s30 in all the other reviews so i won t waste your time repeating it  but i will give you my impression of this little beauty i have owned many cameras in my day  from brownies to leica s  i count 30  cameras owned over the years  i m not exactly young  i ve had pre war german cameras with great lenses  slr s from most of the major japanese manufacturers  and smaller cameras the past 20 years  because the quality of their pictures had improved enough to make it desirable to use a more portable device to take photographs  i went to a seminar some years ago that had digital photography as its subject  i decided the product was nowhere near film quality and rejected the technology as premature  well  it snuck up on me while i wasn t looking  when the density of the picture reached 3 4 or 5mp the digital age had arrived several months ago i decided to buy a digital camera  i required that it take as good a picture as my 35mm minox and olympus  two rangefinder cameras that have given me great service  it had to be small enough to be able to be carried in a pocket  it had to have an excellent  auto  ability as well as a significant ability to adjust settings  it also had to be affordable  after reading all the reviews  and seeing the cameras in the stores  i initially focused on the olympus c50  5mp and relatively pricey  the olympus c4000  4mp and not very portable  and the olympus d550  3mp  minimal adjusting ability and mixed reviews  i kept deferring my decision to buy  when sale prices started settling down i found that the canon s30 was pricing itself near the c4000  and it had a li ion battery and charger included to boot  the more i thought about the s30  the better it looked  it is small enough to pocket yet not too small to handle  it has an excellent lens  the metal body is very durable  and beautiful  also  canon provides a great tutorial on its web site as well as updates for software and camera firmware  the cost  a major electronics discount store  probably having a slow week  met some internet prices i showed them   bought it for  350 00  new and unopened but i haven t told you how i feel about this product  it s a jewel  the feel of it  the look of it  the sound of it  and it works better than i ever expected  a 16mb compact flash card is not enough only because once the camera is in your hands you must take pictures  no problem  64mb costs about  20 00 now and you can reuse it 1 000 000 times  they say  the battery recharges in about an hour and even the charger is an elegant little device it s not usual for me to get emotional over an inanimate object  last time was over a mooney 201  small aircraft  if you choose this one you may just get hooked  march update  on ebay  i purchased 64mb of compact flash memory for  21 00    3 00 s h  from brandenburkhart  i also purchased an nb 2l battery for  12 00    5 95 s h  from eforcetrading  they both work perfectly  ,professional photographer even amateur expert know quality camera see one much detail write review waste time repeat give impression little beauty own many camera day brownish lice count camera own years exactly young pre war german camera great lenses sir major japanese manufacturers smaller camera past years quality picture improve enough make desirable use portable device take photograph go seminar years ago digital photography subject decide product nowhere near film quality reject technology premature well stick look density picture reach digital age arrive several months ago decide buy digital camera require take good picture mm minor polypus two rangefinder camera give great service small enough able carry pocket excellent auto ability well significant ability adjust settings also unfordable read review see camera store initially focus polypus relatively price polypus portable polypus minimal adjust ability mix review keep defer decision buy sale price start settle find canon prick near li ion battery charge include boot think better look small enough pocket yet small handle excellent lens metal body unable beautiful also canon provide great tutor web site well update software camera firmware cost major electronics discount store probably slow week meet internet price show buy new unopened tell feel product jewel feel look sound work better ever expect mb compact flash card enough camera hand must take picture problem mb cost refuse time say battery charge hour even charge elegant little device usual get emotional intimate object last time money small aircraft choose one may get hook march update bay purchase mb compact flash memory brandenburkhart also purchase battery eforcetrading work perfectly
418,auto, i picked up my brand spankin new f350 xlt longbox supercab srw powerstroke 4x4 about 3 weeks ago and i ve got nothing but good things to say about it the diesel engine is fantastic for towing  i use this truck to pull my land rover around on a flatbed and i can climb grades like there s nothing back there  this motor also gets pretty good mileage  though not as good as i d hoped  i ve been seeing about 15 18 mpg depending upon conditions the downside to the diesel is that it s a gt  more expensive to buy  and b gt  really loud  my i don t think my neighbors like the fact that it sounds like i m firing up a freightliner every morning when i leave for work the interior is spacious and comfortable  if you don t slide the front seats all the way back  there s room in the half sized rear area for real people  not the midgets they usually have in mind when they re desiging extended cabs  i had a friend back there for an 8 hour drive and she didn t complain at all about it  actually  she got the sweet deal because she could lie down  but whatever i have to sand bag the bed when i m not carrying a load because the springs are pretty stiff when it s empty  not a big deal  but certainly something to be aware of  i went with the one ton because i figured that someday i might carry a cab over camper  if you don t need the load carrying ability  i d definitely go with the 250 i ve got the heavy service suspension  and you really do need to get running boards with this sucker  i don t have them yet  and it s a chore for me to climb into this truck  i m 6 2 quot  my mother  5 6 quot  finds it nearly impossible to get in this is a really expensive vehicle when you get the diesel and a reasonable compliment of options  by the time i was out the door  i d paid about  38 000 complaints when the center front seat back is down  acting as a center console  anything you put under it on the seat will slide back and fall off the seat onto the floor behind  this means there s really no good place to put things like cell phones where they can be heard  and readily accessed  i ve got to come up with a solution for this one i got a bunch of slushy  gravely snow splashed on the side of the vehicle  and when i later went to roll down the window  the sand got between the seal and the glass and scratched it all to hell  you d think they could build a seal that actually kept the sand out lt b gt br br  ,pick brand spain new longbox superb saw powerstroke weeks ago get nothing good things say diese engine fantastic owe use truck pull land rover around flash climb grade like nothing back motor also get pretty good mileage though good hop see pg depend upon condition downside diese expensive buy really loud think neighbor like fact sound like fire freightliner every morning leave work interior spacious comfortable slide front seat way back room half size rear area real people midges usually mind desire extend cab friend back hour drive complain actually get sweet deal could lie whatever sand bag bed carry load spring pretty stiff empty big deal certainly something aware go one ton figure someday might carry cab hamper need load carry ability definitely go get heavy service suspension really need get run board suck yet choose climb truck quit mother quit find nearly impossible get really expensive vehicle get diese reasonable compliment option time door pay complaints center front seat back act center console anything put seat slide back fall seat onto floor behind mean really good place put things like cell phone hear readily access get come solution one get bunch flush gravely snow splash side vehicle later go roll window sand get seal glass scratch hell think could build seal actually keep sand br
419,auto, i bought a 2002 eclipse because i had a 1992 v4 rs that i had to get rid of due to the birth of my daughter  now that she no longer requires attention while i m having to manually shift gears  i have me another one  i found the v6 gt to be a lot tighter than the 1992 i had  my husband and i recently went on an 1 100 mile trip in the car to far west texas  we found ourselves repeatedly dodging deer  raccoons  jackrabbits  lizards and any other critter that happened on the road  the eclipse hugged the curves  stayed on the road and responded quickly and this was at speeds of 80 90 miles per hour  it is also quite a bit quieter with very little road noise or engine noise  the clutch and gear shift is soft and quick  i don t have any problems with grinding  while shifting  when i skip a gear  the sound system is nice  my daughters car seat fits nicely in the back and i don t have problems getting her out  i can fit more stuff in my eclipse than i can in my stratus  i would recommend this car for a responsible  mature driver  i would not recommend it for a teenager  the car will flat get away from you given the chance  ,buy ellipse get rid due birth daughter longer require attention mentally shift years another one find lot tighter husband recently go mile trip car far west texas find repeatedly lodge deer raccoons jackrabbit wizards write happen road ellipse hug curve stay road respond quickly speed miles per hour also quite bite quieter little road noise engine noise clutch gear shift soft quick problems grind shift skin gear sound system nice daughters car seat fit nicely back problems get fit stuff ellipse status would recommend car responsible mature driver would recommend teenager car flat get away give chance
420,camera, well  the first opinion will tell all of the features of this camera  so i will talk a bit about the image quality and make a few comparative statements the very first thing i noticed when i pulled this camera out of the box  is that it is the sharpest looking camera i have ever seen  so if looks are important to you then check this baby out i printed out a 8 5 x 11 inch print on a dye sub printer and compared it to a similar print done from the fuji 4700  the 4700 had excellent close up detail  but small text in the background  though legible  was not sharp  the 6800 had even better close up detail  and i could clearly read all of the small text  license plates  in the background  there was a whole lot less pixelization in the 6800  color reproduction was also very accurate  the colors in my print were just about dead on without any manipulation at all now we can talk a bit about zooming ratios  with digital cameras  resolution has a huge part to play in the zooming capability of the camera  the higher the resolution  the more detail you will see  and therefore the more you can magnify the image  this is basically the same concept as using finer grain films to get a bigger enlargement  you can magnify a 100 asa film much more than you can an 800 asa film  likewise you can magnify a 6 megapixel image more than you can a 1 megapixel image  so the point i am getting to is this  the effective zooming ability of one camera can be compared to the effective zooming ability of another camera by multiplying the resolution by the optical zoom and then simply seeing which one comes out with the bigger number  for instance  you have a 1 mp camera with a 3x optical zoom  1 times 3 is 3  then you have a 3 mp camera with a 3x optical zoom  3 times 3 is 9  so the 3 mp camera has 3 times the effective optical zooming ability of the other camera  so now you can do the math on the 6800 yourself and compare the zoom to any other camera out there the math above may easily be confused with digital zoom  however  they are not the same thing  the above formula is simply a way of linking the actual enlarging capacity of the image to the telephoto capacity of the lens  digital zoom has nothing to do with the lens on the camera in fact  i would say that digital zoom should not even be taken into consideration when buying a digital camera  your computer can do the digital zooming after you transfer the image onto your hard drive  and the computer can do it faster and to the exact area you want it to  and it won t eat your precious battery power by the by  the 6800 uses fuji s np 80 battery  which means excellent battery life and the ability to charge the battery without removing it from the camera  ,well first opinion tell feature camera talk bite image quality make comparative statements first thing notice pull camera box sharpest look camera ever see look important check baby print inch print dye sub printer compare similar print do full excellent close detail small text background though legible sharp even better close detail could clearly read small text license plat background whole lot less pixelization color reproduction also accurate color print dead without manipulation talk bite boom ratio digital camera resolution huge part play boom capability camera higher resolution detail see therefore signify image basically concept use finer grain film get bigger enlargement signify film much film likewise signify megapixel image megapixel image point get effective boom ability one camera compare effective boom ability another camera multiply resolution optical room simply see one come bigger number instance camera optical room time camera optical room time camera time effective optical boom ability camera path compare room camera path may easily confuse digital room however thing formula simply way link actual enlarge capacity image telephone capacity lens digital room nothing lens camera fact would say digital room even take consideration buy digital camera computer digital boom transfer image onto hard drive computer faster exact area want eat precious battery power use full battery mean excellent battery life ability charge battery without remove camera

422,auto, you may have read my initial review of the 2001 focus zx3 where i lauded the car s impressive features for the price  impressive handling  styling and comfort  to say i am  dissappointed  six months and 7 000 miles into my ownership experience  is a gross understatement this vehicle has spent 16 days in the shop because of a variety of fuel system and transmission problems   5spd manual  the dealership initially insisted that there was nothing wrong with the transmission and that they could not duplicate my complaint  after doing exhaustive internet research  i found that the transmission problem affects almost every focus with the 5 speed manual  i also found that although ford initially denied there was any such problem  the company has recently issued a service bulletin regarding  gear rollover noise gear rollover causes a distinct chattering from the transmission  the car sounds like an old diesel engine  there is no doubt that the noise will substantially impair the trade or resale value of this car and it suggests that a more serious transmission problem is yet to come  ford says the noise is  normal  gas consumption is much less than ford claims under all driving conditions the engine loses rpm and stumbles  as if it s going to stall  at almost every traffic light  my dealer has been unable to fix the stumble there is a noise coming form the cargo area which sounds like a mechanic left a wrench or something inside the body i am filing for the lemon law hearing this week  i highly suggest you run a word search in the usenet archives and check out the problems people are reporting with their focus  ,may read initial review focus x land car impressive feature price impressive handle say comfort say disappoint six months miles ownership experience gross understatement vehicle spend days shop variety fuel system transmission problems sad manual leadership initially insist nothing wrong transmission could duplicate complaint exhaustive internet research find transmission problem affect almost every focus speed manual also find although ford initially deny problem company recently issue service bulletin regard gear follower noise gear follower cause distinct chatter transmission car sound like old diese engine doubt noise substantially impair trade result value car suggest serious transmission problem yet come ford say noise normal gas consumption much less ford claim drive condition engine lose rum stumble go stall almost every traffic light dealer unable fix stumble noise come form cargo area sound like mechanics leave french something inside body file lemon law hear week highly suggest run word search send archive check problems people report focus
423,auto, styling  i have to say  in my opinion  i really don t like the styling of the impala  it s traditional  generic  over styling typical for a general motors vehicle  but obviously it doesn t offend those loyal to the blue bowtie mark because it is one of chevrolet s best selling models safety safety features  standard are dual front airbags for both front passengers  a driver s side  side airbag is optional  i have no idea why chevrolet offers a driver side only side airbag  other than they might be afraid that a child will be sitting in the passenger s front seat and the child could be leaning toward the airbag  increasing their chance of injury from it  however  other car companies have went around this by just installing a sensor in the seat that deactivates the airbag if someone is leaning in its path  most likely its just typical gm bean counting  they didn t want to invest the time or the money in developing the seat sensor so they just didn t put a side airbag for the passenger in at all  also  recently gm has deleted standard abs on many of their models safety ratings  the impala has done well on all its crash tests  it received a dual five star frontal crash test rating from the government  side impact tests were excellent as well  four stars for front and rear passengers  the insurance institute for highway safety  iihs  gave the impala a  good  rating in its frontal crash test handling  there is a major difference in handling between the base model and the ls trim line  the base model has a marshmallow like suspension that does not promote good stability at highway speeds  the ls has a more aggressively tuned suspension  which is a bit firmer and it doesn t compromise the ride at all  the impala does not come close to its competition at all in terms of handling  mainly the accord and passat  but  those stepping up from the lumina will be more than happy ride  like many gm products in the past  both the base and ls model suspensions are overly soft  the base model is the worst  the ride on the highway is comfortable but leaves you wondering what would happen if you had to make an evasive maneuver at high speeds  the ls s ride is similar to that of the base models  only more controlled  if i had to swerve around an object at highway speeds  i wouldn t be worried about it at all in an accord or a passat  but i d be really worried how the base model impala would handle this situation build quality  you would think that chevrolet would catch on to the reason why honda and toyota are out selling them  build quality is horrible  the dash has large gaps between panels  and the materials themselves aren t exactly of good quality  the leather on the seats is thin  shiny  and rather cheap feeling and so is the padding underneath them  the paint job wasn t bad  but the panel gaps were large compared to its competitors  one problem we ve had on our impala is that we had to have the front doors re hung on their hinges because they began to sag so badly that we had to lift the door up slightly to close it so we wouldn t damage the car  the driver s side door is sounding like it needs to be re hung again at only 24 000 miles  the dealer tells us this is normal  and they have had to do it to many other impalas interior  as i have said in the  build quality  section  it leaves much to be desired as far as quality  ergonomics are average and so are the seats  roominess is one of the impala s strengths  there is more than enough room for all passengers  the reflection of the sun from the dash is horrible  you would have thought they learned from the previous model that this is not safe and very distracting on sunny days  audio  the sound quality coming from the speakers is horrid  highs might as well be non existent  the midrange is lacking to say the least  the bass   the worst and most annoying think about this sound system  seems ok at lower levels  but turn it up a little past normal and everything becomes muddy and distorted  needless to say  i do not listen to the radio in this car engines  there are two to choose from  a 3 4l v 6 or a 3 8l v 6  the first engine offers a meager 180 horsepower that moves the base model adequately  the ls trim line gives 200 more horsepower  which allows the impala to compete much better with other cars in its class  value  gm is trying to up the value with this car by offering 0  apr for sixty months  which may attract many looking to buy in this segment  however  i would choose the accord  camry  or passat over this car any day overall  the impala is basic transportation  and there are cars that offer better quality and design for the same money  if your thinking of buying the impala  make sure you drive the competition first  when the lease ends next year  we won t be sad to see this car go  ,say say opinion really like say imply traditional genetic say typical general motor vehicle obviously offend loyal blue bowie mark one chevrolet best sell model safety feature standard dual front airbags front passengers driver side arbat optional idea chevrolet offer driver side side arbat might afraid child sit passenger front seat

424,auto, the 1999 grand cherokee  codenamed the  quot wj quot  to jeepheads  is the first redesign of the grand cherokee since it s introduction in 1993  the  quot zj quot  model daimler chrysler went all out on this machine  hired porsche to do the bodywork  you can tell it s much more aerodynamic than the previous generation  particularly when they re parked side by side  the brand new v8 engine is more powerfull than the previous  and more fuel efficient too  not including the 1998 limited 5 9 liter model  though  the interior is very nice  and the drivetrain  well  the drivetrain is what so many love and hate about the vehicle  the drivetrain of a vehicle is it s heart and soul  it can make or break a car  you can have the worst interior  the worst ergonomics  but one heck of a drivetrain  and the car will be famous  and loved by many and desired by many more  case in point  the viper  you could also have a car with the best interior  the most luxurious appointments ever designed  but have a really poor drivetrain  and the car will flop   ok  so i can t think of any cases here  i guess if you spend that much money designing the interior  you ll hire someone competent to do the drivetrain too the grand cherokee s new drivetrain  is a mixed blessing  the design of the quadra drive is nothing short of sheer brilliance  a 4 5 speed transmission  2 2nd gears  for upshifting and downshifting  viscous differentials all the way around  so if 3 wheels completely lose traction  one will still have it  despite what they may claim  no production awd car has this capability  it s quite simply astounding  particularly in very poor roads or off road situations  its like having detroits or arbs at your beck and call  sorry  jeep tech speak slipped in there the problem  is spotty quality  there are numerous complaints about the drivetrain failing  mostly due to poor quality control with the parts that make the viscous coupling differentials  or the transmission itself  i have heard numerous  quot fixes quot  for these problems in all the message boards i ve hung around in  but there seems to be no sure fire bet  the funny thing about it  if you can call this funny  is that a grand cherokee will be complete heaven  or complete  other place  throughout it s life  most  at least 90  of grand cherokee 99  owners have had 0 problems with the vehicle  and  judging from the past performance of grand cherokees  they never will  it s those 10  that get a faulty one  that have the problem  no matter what they do to try and fix it  the problems allways come back  every time  every case  not only is this frustrating to the owner  but the mechanics go absolutely batty trying to figure out what s causing the problems to keep re appearing  i know some of the best mechanics in the us  that can completely change around a vehicle or build a brand new one from the ground up  with nothing more than simple paper sketches  and they have not been able to figure it out  do cars have auras if you get a good one  you will absolutely fall in love with it head over heals  it is honestly that good  if you get a bad one  you will rue the day you decided to purchase one  and can t understand why so many people like them so much so  writing an opinion on this vehicle is particularly tricky  on one hand  it is a marvel of engineering  and  if you get a good one  quite simply nothing will stand up to it in comparative testing  and it s just a joy to drive  on road or off  it s quiet as a caddy  the ride is smooth as silk  for an suv  the engine performance is superb  and even the gas milage is better than expected  the seats are comfy  etc  etc  etc if you get a bad one  well  ouch it eventually  to me  boils down to the ever burning question   quot would i reccomend this vehicle to a friend quot  and the answer is i simply don t know  90  odds are fairly good  but would you  really  put a friend into a position where there s a 10  chance that they could be bjorked and considering that the problems wouldn t make themselves clear untill after a few thousand miles at least  its not like they could be detected on the lot  so test driving one simply won t work if chrysler s customer service was as good as it should be  and replace those vehicles that are faulty instead of trying to nitpick them to death or simply ignore the owners and hope they ll go away  i would reccomend one whole heartedly so  while this review will have a  quot not reccomended to friends quot  on it  i still think it is a fine vehicle  and if you want to take the risk  go for it this review is probobly one of the hardest i ve ever written anywhere  since i am a hard core jeep guy  my cherokee has 260 000 miles on it  and i still love it  but i do place credit where credit is due  and i also put blame where blame is due  as well  if you have any doubts  i would wait untill the next model year  and see if dc has decided to seriously investigate these problems  because untill they do  i have no choice but to avoid the vehicle that i want to buy when i retire br br  ,grand cherokee codenamed quit quit jeepheads first design grand

425,auto, i have owned a 1998 mitsubishi 3000 gt  base model  for a year  i purchased it brand new with all options including leather and infinity sound system at a great price  with the 100k extended warranty basically this car should have never been made  who puts a 160 hp v6 in a 3350 lbs car  it is very sluggish and slow off of the line  although i found good acceleration  compared to an escort  in 3rd and 4th gears  at first suspension and handling seemed good but only if you are going straight  it takes corners at higher speeds poorly for a high performance sports car  also  if you try to break around a corner  the breaks lock up  i have had this happen to me three times all leading to accidents  by the way anti lock breaks are not even an option on the base model  my car didn t last long enough for me to test its engine reliability but many electrical parts had to be replaced within the first year the only thing going for this car is its looks overall  i wouldn t even consider this a sports car  it has a galant engine  and lack of antilock brakes in such a heavy car makes it extremely unsafe  it fits two people and maybe a duffle bag in the trunk  don t even try to fit a small suitcase in the trunk or a passenger in back seat  unless they are yoga masters they will not fit  even small children complain  i learned my lesson  if you want a 3000 gt buy the vr4  now i know why they discontinued this model  it was one of the most unreliable and unsafe cars i have owned br br  ,own mitsubishi base model year purchase brand new option include leather infinity sound system great price extend warranty basically car never make put les car sluggish slow line although find good acceleration compare escort rd th years first suspension handle seem good go straight take corner higher speed poorly high performance sport car also try break around corner break lock happen three time lead accidents way anti lock break even option base model car last long enough test engine reliability many electrical part replace within first year thing go car look overall even consider sport car galant engine lack antilock rake heavy car make extremely safe fit two people maybe ruffle bag trunk even try fit small suitcase trunk passenger back seat unless master fit even small children complain learn lesson want buy know discontinue model one reliable safe cars own br
426,camera, i m a little ashamed to admit  i was first attracted to this camera by it s looks   boxy   snub nose  brushed metal  retro look  beautiful after doing a lot of research on this camera  and reading the excellent reviews here by  mbfd316  and  keithw 2000  i made the purchase decision in it s price range  i really don t think there is a better camera  before this  i ve bought and used cameras by olympus  three of them  nikon  coolpix  sony  1st generation mavica  and others  if you have windows xp  setup is more automatic than you can imagine  plug it in  xp finds it  identifies it as a  usb storage  device  and installs drivers  you don t even need the supplied drivers  or software  please make sure to click the  remove hardware  icon in your system tray and  stop  this  usb device  before unplugging it  the world won t end if you forget this  but it sure won t hurt you are then given the choice of launching whatever image editing software is in your computer   begin editing  or simply launch windows xp s explorer to drag   drop photos  for windows 98se  you may be asked to insert the supplied cd  then click enter to let windows find and install the driver  some of the reviews i read around the internet on this camera complained of less than stellar performance in low light  i have found this to be at least as good as most or many digital cameras in this category  i even tested it under  no light  by putting it on a tripod at night and taking a photograph of a city skyline  the photograph was great  all point n shoot cameras are going to have some limitations in poorly lit  indoor settings  any camera that attempts to use a tiny  built in flash will inevitably encounter limitations   particularly  digital  you just have to remember to keep your subjects well lit for indoor photos testing this camera indoors with existing light   i ve found it to be passable  and no worse than what is  normal  in the point and shoot world features     i ll begin by saying that this camera has some great ones  most notably  the ability to adjust your asa   iso settings  there is also a  forced flash  or  fill flash  capability  as well as cancelling flash  and even a low light sync mode   which i tested in a night photo with great results  adjustable white balance and manual adjustment to exposure compensation  from minus 1 5 to plus 1 5 in third step increments  is great for a camera in this price range    macro capability is outstanding here  i am amazed at how close  clear and sharp my extreme close ups are    video out  having the video out capability means you can record your little clips and photographs to video tape and send them to friends and relatives who don t even have a computer  useability   this camera is easy to use  in the automatic  point and shoot mode  some will complain about the lens cap  just make sure you have it tethererd to the camera with the supplied cord  and you ll be alright overall   i was amazed at the care with which this was packaged  it was definitely intended to be a quality offering and it is  the owner s manual is a book  about an inch or two thick  and weighing nearly a pound  detailed and informative bonus   the imaging software supplied with this camera is  image expert  which you might also know as  after shot  by the excellent people at jasc   the people who bring you  paint shop pro  consider this a  49 bonus  it is excellent software made specifically with digital cameras in mind i ve been printing up some outstanding 5 x 7 photographs of portraits  wild life and even night shots   a few 8 x 10  but that costs a lot of money in ink the costco where i live has a processing station where you bring in your smart media card and insert it   select the photos you want printed  take your card back   then come back to pick up your printed photos a few days later  just as if you d dropped off a roll of film  i tried this and am now hooked on it  what a fantastic benefit  and at only 24 cents per print my prints from the processsor were great  maybe i just wasn t asking enough of the digital realm  but i ve gotten much more than i d expected with this camera  if you re considering the fuji finepix 2600 or the canon powershot a40  consider this one as well  i think this a near equal  and in some cases better camera  and a much better value  ,little ashamed

427,camera, first   do not buy this camera if you plan to use it under linux   it does not conform to the usb specification  and will not work without you doing some kernel hacking that said  i m happy with the camera  i ve had it one month  and apart from two wasted days trying to get it to work on my system  i only run professional software  nothing from redmond  it has performed flawlessly b my use for the camera   snapshots for sending to friends and family  will probably never print  or maybe only rarely  no intention of using it for anything professional b quick blurb about the usb drive mechanism   this is really nifty  it allows you to plug the camera into your computer s usb port  and the camera appears as a disk drive with jpeg images in a standard subdirectory  it was trivial to write a hotplug script which detects the camera being plugged in  mounts it  transfers all the pictures to local disk  deletes the pictures from the camera  and unmounts the camera with a suitable alert sound  no need for me to unlock my screen  i can just snap pictures  upload them  repeat  then look at the pictures later pros  what i like about it b excellent human factors   the olympus engineers outdid themselves  all controls are simple  easy to find  even for a fumblefingers like me  and easy to use  the most frequently changed settings  flash  and macro mode  are accessible via hotkeys  without having to navigate menus  if you do have to use the menus  they are mostly clear  just two or three obscure icons b excellent picture quality   very sharp  clear pictures  much better than i had hoped for  but bear in mind  i m a simpleton  and not as picky as some true digital photography mavens b the usb drive mechanism  mentioned above  no need for cumbersome clicky gui nonsense or special software b excellent zoom and macro   the 3x optical zoom is fantastic  at least for this newbie unaccustomed to such fancy features  the macro operation takes very clear pictures b lots more features  such as the lcd viewscreen  ability to expand way past the 8m card  long battery life  102 pictures so far  most with flash  and battery is still going strong  goodly 1280x960 resolution  but all of this information and more is available form the product literature  and you don t need to read about it here  suffice it to say that i m happy with  all  the features cons  the bad news b does not conform to the usb specification   there s a checksum that s implemented incorrectly  wintendoze doesn t check this value  unsurprisingly  which is why the camera works under that os b awkward lens cover   the lens cover slider is a little hard to open  especially when wearing gloves  it can also be jarred unintentionally when taking pictures  drawing the lens in  this just takes some getting used to in short  what a fantastic little camera  if only the olympus firmware developers had been a little more professional about testing  i would be unhesitating in my glowing recommendation of this unit  as is  the fact that they blundered something so obvious makes me question what else they may have screwed up  ,first buy camera plan use line conform us specification work without keener hack say happy camera one month apart two waste days try get work system run professional software nothing edmund perform fearlessly use camera snapshots

428,camera, after 3 months of use  including quick shots in all kinds of lighting during the holidays  i now believe digital cameras can replace the 35mm slr for most users  first to some concerns others have noted  you can save your desired settings as defaults for the next time you turn on the camera  see all reset in the mode setup menu  while the lcd image of a picture tends to look over exposed at times  the pictures actually saved and viewed or printed have been excellent  getting a smartmedia reader on my win me computer  images processed by picture it  and printed via an hp ink jet have been no problems  8x10 s of a variety of 2 and 3 mb images have been impressive  the flash is not as good as an external unit on my slr  but is still quite adequate for the typical inside family shots  fill flash and long flash off exposures work well  the fast lens is invaluable  i had no problems with the remote control  battery life has been very good  i use the lcd most of the time to get the image framed properly  the reassurance of aa s working in a pinch is nice  the 128mb non oem smart media card works perfectly  i have found the menus and controls quite reasonable  study the menu structure via the lcd  a button turns it on  and practice  i haven t found any meaningful errors in the manual  but some of the exposure compensation adjustments  with vs without flash  are not clear  everyone would arrange the menu structure differently  i wish some adjustments were built into the mode dial and back buttons instead of where they are in the menus  i fastened the lens cap with the included strap and have trained myself to always take it off before turning the camera mode dial from off to p  on  since the lens extends  all in all these are minor learning experiences and issues for an excellent camera  ,months use include quick shots kinds light holiday believe digital camera replace mm sir users first concern others note save desire settings default next time turn camera see rest mode set menu lead image picture tend look expose time picture actually save view print excellent get smartmedia reader win computer image process picture print via ink jet problems variety mb image impressive flash good external unit sir still quite adequate typical inside family shots fill flash long flash exposures work well fast lens invaluable problems remote control battery life good use lead time get image frame properly assurance work pinch nice mb non dem smart media card work perfectly find venus control quite reasonable study menu structure via lead button turn practice find meaningful errors manual exposure compensation adjustments vs without flash clear everyone would arrange menu structure differently wish adjustments build mode dial back button instead venus fasten lens cap include strap train always take turn camera mode dial since lens extend minor learn experience issue excellent camera
429,camera, let me preface this review by saying that i would never spend  900 on a camera  digital or otherwise  i don t have the money for that  my wife and i received this camera as a gift from her parents last christmas   an extremely generous gift  you might say  well  you are correct  in any event  we were pleasantly surprised to be given this camera  let me explain the camera to you very briefly from a non professional photographer s point of view the camera has a great shape to it  it s small and light and fits nicely into your hand  it is very aesthetically pleasing  it s silver surface and large zoom lens attract attention whenever i take it out  when turned on  there are 3 options play  still  and movie  in play mode you are able to view all of the pictures currently stored on your memory stick  you can do this by jogging through each picture 1 by 1 or by scrolling through an index  the pictures only take about 3 seconds to load on the screen  so patience is not required  in still mode you are able to take still pictures  the features that the camera offers are so numerous that i wouldnt do them all justice  besides  many of them are beyond my scope of need as a casual photographer  it is very simple to switch between color  b w  sepia  and negative effects using the on screen menu  the flash bulb pops up with the slide of a switch  when you press the little silver button to take a picture there is an audible  click  that you hear that lets you know you have taken a picture  in movie mode  you are able to shoot mpeg movies  i have only used this feature once with mixed results  the camera actually captured the sound well  as i was taping my wife singing  the video was not the best quality  but i m sure if i played with the settings i could get it to be better let me recap the pros and cons with this camera for you pro the camera looks great  is lightweight  and feels good and stable in your hands pro for the first time user  the camera is easy to operate  just turn on  put in still mode  and press the shutter button pro the usb cable  supplied with camera  has worked great for me  pictures are uploaded to my computer at a rate of about 3 15 seconds per picture  depending on what resolution you have it set on pro the highest resolution lets you take clear  crisp  8 5x11s  the lowest setting still gives you clear 3x5 s pro the camera shuts itself off after 5 minutes of no use so you dont waste the battery pro  the mgi photosuite software that came with the camera has been very clutch for me  it works great and i use it a lot con the price  this bad boy is gonna run you at least 900 bucks  if you got the money  then i by all means recommend it  if you re scrapped for cash  you might do better getting a  50 cheapy at wal mart  con the manual is alright  but i thought it could have been better written  there are alot of features that i havent explored with mine for fear of mining through the manual for the information con no case  they include a brochure featuring a nice case you can buy for around 40 bucks  but after paying all that money for the camera  its like a small slap in the face con the memory stick included is only 8mb  this didnt affect me because my in laws included a 32mb stick with our present that is more than adequate  i can take 50 pictures at a mid level resolution and still have space left  if i only had 8mb i would be annoyed con  the battery does tend to run out pretty fast  but i like the meter which lets you accurately know how long you have left  if sony would have included a second battery  they would have added a ton of value to this product con  the flash is extremely bright  maybe there s a setting where i can change that  but i havent found it yet  almost every pic i take with the flash makes the subjects look as if they have not been in sunlight for 2 3 years  i often take pictures w o it and then enhance the pictures and brighten them using the software supplied  ,let preface review say would never spend camera digital otherwise money wife receive camera gift parent last christmas extremely generous gift might say well correct event pleasantly surprise give camera let explain camera briefly non professional photographer point view camera great shape small light fit nicely hand aesthetically please silver surface large room lens attract attention whenever take turn option play still movie play mode able view picture currently store memory stick log picture stroll index picture take second load screen patience require still mode able take still picture

430,camera, i am not  yet  an owner of an fd73  so it may seem odd that i m writing a recommendation for it  i sell stuff on ebay  and in order to have an image of my items  i bought a kodak dc10 a few years ago  nice pix  but very limited in the zoom and closeup requirements  my friend  however  has a sony fd73  and in helping him with lighting and backgrounds  i came to discover how useful the camera really is  and i borrow it frequently  the zoom range is 10 to 1  from wide angle to true telephoto  the lens focuses  very sharply too  to 1 2 inch from your subject  i ve taken pix of a coin in one frame  a large camera on the next  and shots of damage done to my neighbor s house on the following shots  without any changes or additional accessories  itis also useful for taking pictures of valuable objects and collections  as well as general inventory of home furnishings  for insurance purposes  the pictures are very sharp and clear  but i recommend using an imaging program other than the one supplied with the camera for doing something more than  quot tweaking quot  or re sizing  adobe  microsoft  and a host of other software makers have good imaging applications  my personal choice is micrografx picture publisher 8  the camera s fundamental drawback is the lack of higher resolution required to make decent prints  if you can be satisfied with prints measuring no more than 4x5 inches  you can be satisfied with the fd73  for web use  i have not seen a camera more suitable  once you ve learned to accurately frame your picture within the camera  it is a simple task to put the disk in your  quot a quot  drive  send it to your web  or image hosting  site  and re name it there  other photographers who contribute to photo chat rooms  such as ebay s  seem to recommend it highly  too  their general opinion is that the word  quot ebay quot  should be inscribed on the camera body   ,yet owner ff may seem odd write recommendation sell stuff bay order image items buy today years ago nice six limit room close requirements friend however sonya ff help light background come discover useful camera really borrow frequently room range wide angle true telephone lens focus sharply inch subject take six coin one frame large camera next shots damage do neighbor house follow shots without change additional accessories also useful take picture valuable object collections well general inventor home furnish insurance purpose picture sharp clear recommend use imagine program one supply camera something quit take quit seize adore microsoft host software makers good imagine applications personal choice micrografx picture publisher camera fundamental drawback lack higher resolution require make decent print satisfy print measure inch satisfy ff web use see camera suitable learn accurately frame picture within camera simple task put disk quit drive send web image cost site name photographer contribute photo chat room bay seem recommend highly general opinion word quit bay quit inscribe camera body
431,auto, i was immediately intrigued with the jaguar s type when i saw it at the auto show in cleveland  my trepidation came from memories of pushing the products of british leyland which in the end permanently damaged my back  no more english cars i promised myself however  the austin healy 3000 that did it to me  i think  is one of the best looking cars ever built  the s type was a nod in the same direction  with one difference   ford  i couldn t imagine ford owning a vehicle that craps out after driving through a puddle  so with trepidation  i bought a s type with the 4 0l v 8  after two years of drenching rain  hail  heat  dust  every type of weather thrown at it  this jag has not only never failed  it has never faltered  i don t get to drive it much  because my wife has taken it over  but when i do drive it  it is a superb handler on the highway  this car is fun to drive   it is tight  fast and sure footed  and another dimension that i don t read about in other reviews is the turning radius   this car has the tightest turning radius of any car i have ever driven  the best is when i drop my wife off at church and pull into a short break in a line of parked cars where the church driveway is  other cars doing the same thing block the curb lane  i pull all the way in  allowing traffic to move in the curb lane  and when traffic clears  i don t have to back up to clear the parked car just ahead of the driveway  i pull right out another remarkable feature is the navigation system  my wife had to make a number of residential deliveries into neighborhoods she was unfamiliar with  for political campaign purposes  she just programmed the addresses into the navigation system  and the navigation to each house was perfect  we have also successfully used the navigation system to find restaurants we are unfamiliar with   as a matter of fact we have come to depend upon it my trepidation is gone   this car is a real performer  fun to drive and when you get it out on the interstate on a long drive  it is like silk with nice growl  ,immediately intrigue january type saw auto show cleveland trepidation come memories push products british leland end permanently damage back english cars promise however austin heavy think one best look cars ever build type nod direction one difference ford imagine ford own vehicle crop drive puddle trepidation buy type two years wrench rain hail heat dust every type weather throw jaw never fail never falter get drive much wife take drive superb handle highway car fun drive tight fast sure loot another dimension read review turn radius car lightest turn radius car ever drive best drop wife church pull short break line mark cars church driveway cars thing block curb lane pull way allow traffic move curb lane traffic clear back clear mark car ahead driveway pull right another remarkable feature navigation system wife make number residential deliver neighborhoods unfamiliar political campaign purpose programme address navigation system navigation house perfect also successfully use navigation system find restaurant unfamiliar matter fact come depend upon trepidation go car real performer fun drive get interstate long drive like silk nice growl
432,camera, when i purchased the dc 215 i was very skeptical about spending this kind of money on product i wasn t sure would really be worth it  normally when something fairly new comes out  it is less than user friendly well in the case of this camera i was very impressed  and i still am  i can normally fit 12  14 photos on one disk  even though the thought of having to install a program on the computer just to download the images seemed like a bad idea  it actually made it easier to work with and to adjust the picture to exactly how i wanted to see it  the dc 215 is very easy to use and has many options  the good thing is there isn t so many options that you walk away from it with your head spinning  it has the sophisticated look  the complex look  yet  very easy and fun  i think the ability to zoom and view on the lcd screen is my favorite part  it may be the simplest but none the less the part i like the most  this camera takes very good quality pictures  i have yet to take one that i didn t like  and if you don t want to keep one of the pictures you can simply delete that one from the disk and move on  if you can afford it buy it  it is a great and fun camera that will keep you taking pictures faster than you can say film developing br br  ,purchase skeptically spend kind money product sure would really worth normally something fairly new come less user friendly well case camera impress still normally fit photo one disk even though think install program computer download image seem like bad idea actually make easier work adjust picture exactly want see easy use many option good thing many option walk away head spin sophisticate look complex look yet easy fun think ability room view lead screen favorite part may simplest none less part like camera take good quality picture yet take one like want keep one picture simply delete one disk move afford buy great fun camera keep take picture faster say film develop br
433,camera, i ve been watching the digital camera phenomenon for several years now  last year i purchased a kodak dc215 and was a bit disappointed  this year i bought the nikon coolpix800 for only a little more than what i paid for the dc215  and i am completely satisfied with it  this camera make sense both as a one size fits all solution for quality internet business and artistic use  and as a supplemental camera for a professional or serious amateur who needs a lightweight but still high quality tool for specific situations where the weight and bulk of professional equipment is not desired  the price performance ratio of digital photography finally came into clear focus for me with this well designed product  i had three different reasons for purchasing a digital camera 1  quick image processing for the internet 2  visual reference  quot notes quot  for artistic projects 3  pure photography while the dc215 was  almost  acceptable for application  1  for  2 and  3 it was wholly inadequate  the coolpix800 excels on all three fronts plus  its sturdy construction and light weight make it perfect for long mountain bike rides  full day hikes  and tucking into my pocket when i go exploring uncharted territory  i can t imagine a better camera for these purposes  i don t even notice the weight  and it can take uncompressed tiff images  the menus and controls are well designed  fairly intuitive to use  and mostly unobtrusive now if i could just find a good low cost source for compactflash memory i am completely satisfied with this great product br br  ,watch digital camera phenomenon several years last year purchase today bite disappoint year buy union coolpix little pay completely satisfy camera make sense one size fit solution quality internet business artistic use supplement camera professional serious amateur need lightweight still high quality tool specific situations weight bulk professional equipment desire price performance ratio digital photography finally come clear focus well design product three different reason purchase digital camera quick image process internet visual reference quit note quit artistic project pure photography almost acceptable application wholly inadequate coolpix excess three front plus sturdy construction light weight make perfect long mountain bike rid full day like tuck pocket go explore unchanged territory imagine better camera purpose even notice weight take compress stiff image venus control well design fairly intuition use mostly unobtrusive could find good low cost source compactflash memory completely satisfy great product br
434,camera, i finally decided to get a digital camera given that we are expecting a new child the next month or so  my wife called me crazy when she saw how much research i was doing  i knew nothing about these things  but quickly came up to speed  i knew i didn t want to spend more than  400 and wanted at least 2mp  after searching and searching  it came down to the fuji 2800 and the canon a40  i also considered the fuji 2600 but decided that i liked the other body styles better   plus video with sound was nice   what is the point of video if you can t hear anything i bought both cameras and returned the canon the next day  the image quality on the 2800 is much better from what i can tell  i took alot of indoor shots and the a40 pictures came out unfocused while the 2800 shots came out clear  while the a40 does have tv out  more manual options  better video quality  the 2800 image quality was what convinced me   after all  what are all the bells and whistles if the basic stuff doesn t even work well the evf lcd definitely gets dim in any kind of low light  it doesn t have to be very dark   just a little less than normal indoor lighting will cause significant dimming   the a40 was better about this  but i kind of like the evf  especially since i can see the menu outputs on it and it shows the entire picture the 2800 is basically a souped up entry level camera  there aren t many manual controls  but that s fine for my wife and i  everything is set so you can just start shooting  also  with windows xp  it recognized the camera as a removeable drive easily and i didn t have to install any software  transferring pictures in this manner is just like copy files from a floppy disk  very easy i can t say much about the included software  but i m sure it s decent  the 16mb smartmedia card that is included is not a bad deal   it can take about 40 normal 2mp pictures and about 20 fine 2mp pictures  good for beginning  but i bought a 128mb card  the included alkaline batteries are also okay  but as most suggest  i bought nimh from thomas distributing by the way  i got a great deal  i think    microcenter is having a 20  sale on all digital cameras through june 2  so i went to circuit city  in nh   no sales tax  and price matched  110  price match  to the microcenter sale  originally 379 99   i got it for 294 99  makes me feel a whole lot better too  i got the 128mb card from amazon for  60 and 8 nimh  1800 mah  including charger for another  50 or so  i still have yet to find a good camera case for it since the body is somewhat awkward  i m also considering buying a slave flash to help with indoor lighting  all in all  i came in right around what i had budgeted in all and i am very satisfied  ,finally decide get digital camera give expect new child next month wife call crazy saw much research know nothing things quickly come speed know want spend want least search search come full canon also consider full decide like body style better plus video sound nice point video hear anything buy camera return canon next day image quality much better tell take clot indoor shots picture come focus shots come clear manual option better video quality image quality convince bell whistle basic stuff even work well eve lead definitely get dim kind low light dark little less normal indoor light cause significant din better kind like eve especially since see menu output show entire picture basically souse entry level camera many manual control fine wife everything set start shoot also windows recognize camera removable drive easily install software transfer picture manner like copy file floppy disk easy say much include software sure decent mb smartmedia card include bad deal take normal picture fine picture good begin buy mb card include alkaline batteries also okay suggest buy nigh thomas distribute way get great deal think microcenter sale digital camera june go circuit city sales tax price match price match microcenter sale originally get make feel whole lot better get mb card amazon nigh may include charge another still yet find good camera case since body somewhat awkward also consider buy slave flash help indoor light come right around budget satisfy
435,camera, i ve been wanting a digital camera for almost three years  since the days of  high resolution 640x480  pictures  but would never take the plunge because the technology was not  right  yet  the canon g1 made me change my mind and am i pleased i bought it to make easier to read the review  i ll separate it into topics 1  image quality that s the most important thing for me  and any top 3 3 mpixel camera will get you a very good picture  it is still less than half the quality of 35mm pictures taken with a good slr camera  which tops at about 8 mpixels  but if you are gonna used it digitally  the scanning process would probably even things out  that said  a  800 dollar digital camera can already take on a  200 slr 2  features here is where this camera shines  it is the only one that has a iso 50 mode  that produces great pictures  as with any other camera  using it at 400 iso produces images with extreme noise  so you will want to go up to 100 or maybe iso 200  but being able to view in real time the effect of aperture and shutter speed compensates for it in a sense the battery is fantastic  and you can take more than 500 pictures without having to recharge it  i don t even think a spare is necessary  unless you will be in the wild for some time and there s still the raw format  a lossless format  a la tiff  that occupies 1 3 of the space an uncompressed tiff does  very useful  for you can set up white point  contrast  sharpness and saturation without losing any image quality  if you are taking critical pictures  this is a gift from heaven for comparisons with other cameras  check out this cool site  www dpreview com 3  capacity oh boy  if you are going to buy this camera  do yourself a favor and buy the ibm microdrive  what about taking 130 pictures in raw or 160 in jpeg  maximum quality  without having to upload them to your pc  yes  being able to use the microdrive was the deciding factor for me to buy this camera  and that s for the 340mb microdrive  but it is also available in 512mb and 1gb  you do the math 4  add ons what i really would like is to be able to use slr lenses with digital cameras  but that s not possible with the g1  in truth it s not possible with any camera in this price range you can buy a macro lenses  x 8  or zoom  x1 2  however it is really not worth the money  it is too little for too much 5  conclusion i have some gripes about it  the most severe being the auto focus feature  a pain to use  a lot less precise than the canon 1000fn slr i have  and the pain that is using manual mode with flash and the lcd not compensating for it  so turning black at a high shutter speed aperture combination but take my word  this is a great machine  that will not only amaze your friends  it has happened with me all the time  mostly in parties  but also amaze you with it s features  image quality  battery life and capacity with an added microdrive in other words  if you are willing to spend  800 in a digital camera  go for a canon g1  if you are willing to spend  1050  buy the g1 and a microdrive  you won t regret it br br  ,want digital camera almost three years since days high resolution picture would never take plunge technology right yet canon make change mind please buy make easier read review separate topics image quality important thing top mix camera get good picture still less half quality mm picture take good sir camera top mpixels donna use digital scan process would probably even things say dollar digital camera already take sir feature camera shin one iso mode produce great picture camera use iso produce image extreme noise want go maybe iso able view real time effect aperture shutter speed compensate sense battery fantastic take picture without charge even think spare necessary unless wild time still raw format losses format la stiff occupy space compress stiff useful set white point contrast sharpness situation without lose image quality take critical picture gift heaven comparisons camera check cool site www review com capacity oh boy go buy camera favor buy ism microdrive take picture raw peg maximum quality without unload pp yes able use microdrive decide factor buy camera mb microdrive also available mb go path add really would like able use sir lenses digital camera possible truth possible camera price range buy micro lenses room however really worth money little much conclusion grapes severe auto focus feature pain use lot less precise canon fn sir pain use manual mode flash lead compensation turn black high shutter speed aperture combination take word great machine amaze friends happen time mostly party also amaze feature image quality battery life capacity add microdrive word will spend digital camera go canon will spend buy microdrive regret br
436,camera, i purchased this digital camera  because i am very bad at developing film  i currently have about 20 rolls laying around my house  waiting to be developed  some are from when i was in the army in 1993  needless to say  a digital camera is just what i needed we decided to purchase a camera with part of our income tax refund  we didn t know what brand we were going to buy just yet  but we didn t want to spend over  300 we went to our px on post and saw the polaroid pdc700 at  249 00  it s got a maximum resolution of 1024x768  and an auto timer  most other cameras in this price range i ve seen only have 640x480  it doesn t  however  have zoom on it  it came with a 4 meg memory card  4 batteries  camera to computer cable  camera to tv cable  camera case  wrist strap  ac power adapter  ac power adapter cord  polaroid photomax image maker software cd rom  and polaroid photomax pro software cd rom i ve played with it alot in the last few days  and i m very satisfied with the pictures  i ve heard a few people complain about the image quality  but i have to disagree  while it may not be up to par for a professional photographer  for everyone else  i d say the image quality is great it also comes with an lcd screen to preview your pictures  and either keep or delete them  keep in mind  the images will look better on your computer screen than they do in the lcd screen  that s not to say that the lcd screen is bad  it s just smaller  and pictures look a bit grainier than they do on our computer monitor the software included with this camera is really fun  too  you can touch up the pictures  and add special effects if you d like to  there are alot of effects  some of which are embossing  oil painting  and mosaic i also really like the sleek  expensive look of this camera  it s silvery gold  and dark grey  and quite compact  small enough  in fact  that the camera case has loops on the back so that you can slip it onto a belt  this is nice for people who are in busy areas  and might be worried about it being stolen  personally  i m going to sew a heavy duty strap to the inside  so i can wear it like a purse  since i don t wear belts the only slightly negative thing about this camera is that the batteries don t last long  ours lasted a day  but keep in mind  we shot alot of pictures  we ve learned that when we are in the house  we need to use the ac adapter  and save the batteries for when there aren t any plugs around  i would recommend getting 2 sets of rechargable batteries  so that while you use one set  the other is always charging  thus cutting down on the cost of batteries all in all  i m very happy with the price  performance  and image quality of this camera  it was the least expensive i had found  and was nicer than the other more expensive ones i had looked at  this is one purchase i definitely won t regret br br  ,purchase digital camera bad develop film currently roll lay around house wait develop army needle say digital camera need decide purchase camera part income tax refund know brand go buy yet want spend go pp post saw polaroid get maximum resolution auto time camera price range see however room come meg memory card batteries camera computer cable camera cable camera case wrist strap ac power adapt ac power adapt cord polaroid potomac image maker software polaroid potomac pro software play clot last days satisfy picture hear people complain image quality disagree may par professional photographer everyone else say image quality great also come lead screen review picture either keep delete keep mind image look better computer screen lead screen say lead screen bad smaller picture look bite grinder computer monitor software include camera really fun touch picture add special effect like clot effect boss oil paint mosaic also really like sleek expensive look camera silvery gold dark grey quite compact small enough fact camera case loop back slip onto belt nice people busy areas might worry steal personally go sew heavy duty strap inside wear like purse since wear belt slightly negative thing camera batteries last long last day keep mind shoot clot picture learn house need use ac adapt save batteries plug around would recommend get set rechargable batteries use one set always charge thus cut cost batteries happy price performance image quality camera least expensive find nicer expensive ones look one purchase definitely regret br
437,camera, considering the current price range of quality mega pixel cameras nowadays  i didn t have very high expectations to begin with of my  65 camera  that came with free shipping though  my only purpose for this camera was to take pictures of items i wanted to sell on my website or ebay three hours and two sets of batteries later  i finally was able to take some suitable pictures with the camera  i ended up having to do this outside  where the flash was not required because the flash seemed to make the already blurry pictures even less clear  also  the smaller you resize your picture  the clearer it seems to appear  so be sure to keep that in mind this product definitely has some cool features  such as a self timer to take pictures and the different flash options  but you may not care too much about these features once you actually upload these pictures to the screen and notice the poor resolution i think this camera is a good starter for those who want to see if they would like to fork out the money for a good digital camera  if you really just want the camera to take pictures of items to sell  this camera may just be all you need  however  i might also suggest purchasing a cheap scanner instead for better quality than this camera  also  please make sure you head to your local sam s club and buy some aa batteries in bulk if you plan to use this camera  you ll need them all if you would like to see pictures taken with this camera  go to http www geocities com ritasalbums br br  ,consider current price range quality meg fix camera nowadays high expectations begin camera come free ship though purpose camera take picture items want sell webster bay three hours two set batteries later finally able take suitable picture camera end outside flash require flash seem make already flurry picture even less clear also smaller reside picture clearer seem appear sure keep mind product definitely cool feature self time take picture different flash option may care much feature actually unload picture screen notice poor resolution think camera good start want see would like fork money good digital camera really want camera take picture items sell camera may need however might also suggest purchase cheap scan instead better quality camera also please make sure head local sam club buy batteries bulk plan use camera need would like see picture take camera go http www geocities com ritasalbums br

440,camera, i have been a 35 mm guy for over 30 years and have shot well over 15 000 images including a number of published photos and a magazine cover shot  not bad for an amateur after looking at every consumer level digital camera  i decided on the nikon 995 in august 2001  i shoot a combination of outdoor  landscapes and macro plus industrial photos for my work  i was drawn to the 995 because it is small enough to pack in my computer case or a fanny pack and yet has a full compliment of attachment lenses   2 fish eyes  a wide angle  2 telephotos and a slide copier attachment the camera works in the auto mode right out of the box and is a no brainer  even for someone who has never taken pictures  using the m or programmable mode takes some reading  the manual is over 160 pages  even as an experienced amateur  after 6 months of use i am still reading the manual to learn everything that the camera can do in every mode i bought the wide angle lens  the 500 mm equivalent telephoto  the cable release and the slide copier attachment  the wide angle is great  the 500 mm  as you would expect from any lens of that length  absolutely requires a tripod  the cable release is a pain to use  for telephoto shots i usually use the timer in 3 second mode  push the shutter button twice the slide copier works great and is a real bargain  i have transferred over 300 slides to digital for web publishing  a whole lot cheaper than a slide scanner  and the quality is excellent after 2 000 pictures including an extensive industrial shoot for a powerpoint presentation  about 2 hours of  mov files  video without sound  and hundreds of outdoor images  i think i made the right choice  if you are planning on replacing 35mm as i have  you need an extra battery  maybe two  and depending on your interest in quality pictures  filters   skylight  circular polarizer  neutral density  i use 4 digital flash cards  2 128k and 2 64k  enough for a 2 3 day backpacking trip the camera is tough  i dropped it in new orleans  no  i did not have too much to drink  on the concrete from about 4 feet  duh  broke the rotary selector switch  which i replaced myself for  28  don t tell nikon  and the camera is no worse for wear  you should see the electronics inside of this thing  makes a computer look like a toy if you really want to learn to use this camera  find a copy of the mastering nikon compact digital cameras   an ebook on cd  i learned more in 20 minutes than in six months reading the manual  good shooting  ,mm guy years shoot well image include number publish photo magazine cover shoot bad amateur look every consumer level digital camera decide union august shoot combination outdoor landscape micro plus industrial photo work draw small enough pack computer case fanny pack yet full compliment attachment lenses fish eye wide angle telephotos slide copier attachment camera work auto mode right box trainer even someone never take picture use programmable mode take read manual page even experience amateur months use still read manual learn everything camera every mode buy wide angle lens mm equivalent telephone cable release slide copier attachment wide angle great mm would expect lens length absolutely require try cable release pain use telephone shots usually use time second mode push shutter button twice slide copier work great real bargain transfer side digital web publish whole lot cheaper slide scan quality excellent picture include extensive industrial shoot powerpoint presentation hours move file video without sound hundreds outdoor image think make right choice plan replace mm need extra battery maybe two depend interest quality picture filter skylight circular polarizer neutral density use digital flash card enough day backpack trip camera tough drop new orleans much drink concrete feet due break rotary elector switch replace tell union camera worse wear see electronics inside thing make computer look like toy really want learn use camera find copy master union compact digital camera ebook learn minutes six months read manual good shoot
441,camera, first off  i don t consider the e10 to be a professional camera  due to the ccd being smaller than regular film  you can t get the depth of field control that you can get with a regular film camera  and that limits your portrait creativity  the handling of the camera is great  it feels very much like a regular slr  by weight and by function   in record mode  in playback mode  this camera is slow  going from picture to picture  zooming  etc  very slow   my current canon pro90 is is much better in this regard i wish it had interchangeable lenses  i understand olympuses decision based on the threat of dust in the lens  but using a teleconverter leaves a lot of possibility of haze from too many refractions  etc  with the teleconverter  pictures end up quite hazy sometimes  colors lack snap  etc i really like the oly flash  the fl 40 performed great and is a very interesting design  watch out for the infared focus assist  it s easy to block with your finger  and suffers from some parallax issues  but you can shoot in almost total darkness which is cool  viewfinder is great  nothing but pleased with it  but why does it blank when you take a shot  it s not like there is a real shutter in there   i was very happy with the camera  right until it bailed off my motorcycle at 95 mph  causing it to be very quickly demolished  c est la vie  it eats through aas  definitely carry a spare set  ,first consider professional camera due cod smaller regular film get depth field control get regular film camera limit portrait creativity handle camera great feel much like regular sir weight function record mode playback mode camera slow go picture picture boom etc slow current canon pro much better regard wish interchangeable lenses understand olympuses decision base threat dust lens use teleconverter leave lot possibility haze many reflections etc teleconverter picture end quite hay sometimes color lack snap etc really like flash perform great interest design watch injure focus assist easy block finger suffer parallel issue shoot almost total darkness cool viewfinder great nothing please blank take shoot like real shutter happy camera right fail motorcycle may cause quickly demolish est la vie eat definitely carry spare set

445,camera, i was dying for a digital camera  but my college budget cringed at the price tags of the popular brands  then i stumbled across an ad in a mail order catalog for the sipix iquest dualcam  at  29 after a  20 rebate  i couldn t pass it up  was it worth thirty bucks  well  what digital camera isn t  here s my take on the dualcam b hardware  the iquest dualcam is a palm sized unit with run of the mill features for a low end digital camera  it boasts a built in flash  a lens cover that doubles as a power switch  a usb port for pc connections  and a video output jack for viewing images on any tv vcr with an rca input the controls are well organized in five buttons on top of the camera  a quick run down of functions a single button scrolls through the flash options  on off auto another button does double duty as a quality selector and self timer switch  cycling through high and low quality settings with and without the timer there s a play record button  primarily for use when viewing images on an external video source  play mode lets you view and delete images  as expected  but record mode was a little disappointing  the camera displays a decent quality live feed image on a tv  but only allows you to capture still images  several cameras on the market  some of the popular pen cams  for instance  let the user capture video on the go  the dualcam s web cam feature  however  is only available when connected to a pc  finally  the delete and shutter buttons serve only their stated purposes it should come as no surprise that a camera in this price range isn t equipped with a built in lcd image viewer  i will give sipix props for the layout of their status indicator  though  it s easily deciphered  even if it isn t very eye catching   accessories  the connection ports of the dualcam bug me  they re easy to get to  but their position on the lower left side of the unit makes use as a web cam bothersome  with the cables connected  the camera tends to shift under the weight of the cords and leans to the side  why the connections weren t taken around the corner to the back of the unit is boggling  i ve worked around this problem by clamping the cords to the side of my monitor  but it was nonetheless a nuisance the optimal solution would have been to place the connections in a cradle stand  but that would probably have jacked the price up  the stand that  is  supplied leaves a little to be desired  it secures to the camera via a short bolt with a plastic knob on the bottom  this is the same type of attachment many tripods have  but for a tiny webcam it s overkill  on a more pleasant note  the dualcam comes with all its cables  and sipix even includes a pair of aa batteries to get you started  the people at sipix apparently appreciate the fact that it s nice to be able to play with a new toy right out of the box b performance  while including batteries is a nice gesture  the one pair won t save you much money  the dualcam is a glutton in the power department  energizers in my camera have an average life expectancy of 1 2 hours  thankfully  the unit turns itself off after a few seconds of inactivity  but the power drain is still impressive  i just wish i was as impressed by the quality of the images as i am by the device s power consumption  the dualcam offers two levels of picture quality  but despite my most intense inspections i can t see any real difference between low and high  the only noticeable effect is that switching to high quality drops the storage capacity from 24 images to 6  when transferring images to my pc in adobe photoshop via the supplied software  i get 640 x 480 pictures on either setting  at a high level of zoom in photoshop there are a few less pixel distortions  but the difference is negligible  and with no option to increase memory  the high setting certainly isn t worth the number of pictures it costs the camera seems to perform best in the 6 10 foot range  i ve managed some near disposable camera quality images at such distances  and with some creative blurring of backgrounds they don t look too bad  the clarity  however  remains far inferior to an actual disposable camera and a scanner   wrap up  there are other aspects of the unit that could be discussed  one second delay between shutter press and confirmation chirp  two second delay between confirmation and ready light for next picture  but i think the image quality pretty well sums up the overall experience  that s what you buy a camera for in the first place i will mention that the dualcam is adequate as a webcam  capturing at 30 frames second  it keeps up with the rest of the pack of camera webcam combos  but if i had wanted a webcam  i would have bought just that and gotten more focused software and options  do i feel like i was ripped off  no  not really  despite all the shortcomings of the dualcam  it does allow me to snap occassional pictures and quickly access them through my pc  for  29 i feel good about my purchase  had i paid any more for it  i might be less forgiving  if you re looking for a high quality digital camera  you ll have to pay high quality prices   higher than thirty dollars  at least  but if  like i was  you re simply bursting at the seams to get your own digital camera  the dualcam is a nice  cheap starter  if you can find it on sale  i m withholding my recommendation on the dualcam primarily because the quality of the images is so low  for someone who s new to the digital camera game  or who doesn t require crisp photos  this camera would still be pretty good for the price  as a brief side note  i do think this camera would make a good gift for younger users  it performs consistently  and if it gets broken or used as a coaster

446,auto, the 3 series finally made sense to me recently  since the current generation car appeared in 1999 i 146ve had trouble getting excited about it despite many opportunities to drive the car  even after the engine and suspension tweaks a couple years ago  it always seemed smoother and less visceral than i felt a bmw should be  i wanted to have fun  but the car was pursuing technical excellence  fun and technical excellence are not the same thing i 146ve written quite a bit about my mixed emotions towards the 3 series before  for this review i 146ll concentrate on my recent impressions driving a 330 at a bmw sponsored driving course  i drove an automatic 325 wagon at the same event  and a manual 325 coupe at another bmw event  i comment on those in a review of the 2004 325   a href content 118909931140 here a b  in its sixth model year  this is now the oldest car in the class  how 146s it holding up b styling and accommodations  i 146ve never found the current 3 series sedan and wagon strikingly attractive   the coupe and convertible benefit from more rakish proportions  they 146re certainly well proportioned and handsome in a very conventional manner  but rely on large wheels to convey the  147driving machine 148 message  a bit more edge would be nice  just don 146t do anything crazy  mr  bangle  if the improvement of the 2004 5 series over the 2002 7 series is any indication  bmw 146s chief designer will manage to produce a design that is both striking and attractive for the next 3  due in two years  whether the result will age as well as the current car is more dubious inside the 3 is also very conventional  with the center stack canted much less towards the driver than earlier bmws  very little about the interior says  147driver 146s car 148 to me  luxury receives much more emphasis than sport  this is clearly an interior conceived before all of the recent trends towards novel textures and shapes  again  if the improvement of the new 5 146s interior over those in the old one and the 7 is any indication  the next 3 will do just fine here  at present  however  the audi a4 offers a higher class interior while those in the cadillac cts  infiniti g35  lexus is 300  and even the saab 9 3 have more character  if decidedly inferior materials  the new acura tl 146s interior is styled somewhat like the bmw 146s  but manages to feel more up to date and sportier  when i think about it  none of the cars in this segment offers a striking  high quality  interior designed expressly for the enthusiast  so the path is wide open for the next 3 i remain less than happy with the 3 146s driving position  the instrument panel and steering column are simply too high  the new 5 does much better in this area  again hopefully the new 3 will follow  for now i prefer the airier cockpits of the japanese competition i have always felt that the 3 series 146 back seat is roomier than most people seem to realize  the old 5 actually provided a fraction of an inch less rear leg room  the new 5 has a roomier rear seat  making the more expensive car easier to justify  that said  the 3 in sedan and wagon forms provides adequate room and comfort for a pair of adults in back  the coupe and convertible contain more marginal rear seats  but i still wouldn 146t mind spending an hour or two in either the trunk is the 3 is a bit tight but usefully shaped  folding rear seats remain an option on sedans and coupes   on the road  make that  147on the track 148 at a recent bmw sponsored two hour driving course i drove an automatic 330 sedan hard around a track set up in the pontiac silverdome parking lot  sadly the course was just long enough for me to learn how little i know about driving a car well on a track   i found it especially difficult to use the whole width of the track 151in my head i wanted to keep to my side of the  147road 148  on a more positive note  two hours was long enough for me to realize what makes the 3 series a great car  the instruction session prior to track time included a lot of talk about easy transitions between throttle and brake so as not to upset the balance of the chassis and to maintain even loads on the tires  yet that all went out the window on the track  where the instructor commanded me to do things my common sense  and the prior classroom session  told me were crazy 151hard on the throttle  go deep into the turn  hard on the brakes  back hard on the throttle  with the instructor rapidly barking commands i was thoroughly frazzled  thankfully  the car was not  aside from taking out a few cones on my first fast instructional lap  the instructor said he waited too long to tell me to hit the brakes  allowing the car to enter the turn going too fast  the 330 did everything it was told to do without any untoward motions or complaints   the continental tires were another matter 151they complained almost the whole way around the track  even paired with the automatic the extremely smooth  wonderful sounding inline six 3 0 liter engine felt very powerful  many shoppers will note that infiniti and acura offer cars with significantly more powerful engines  but somehow in the real world their advantage largely disappears  quite likely they must use taller gearing to earn acceptable fuel economy my attitude towards serious horsepower depends on the transmission  with an automatic i love it  with a manual i often enjoy a less powerful engine  as i can still charge hard through the gears without ending up in seriously illegal territory  consequently  with the manual i see a strong case for the 325 over the 330  especially since the cost difference is over  5000  you do at least get a little more for the additional cash for 2004  this year the 330 manual gains an extra gear  while the 325 continues to make do with five because the sedan was fitted with an automatic  i never felt as connected to the car as i would have liked  i 146m so used to controlling a car through a clutch and shifter as much as through the other controls that i felt like a fish out of water the whole way around the course   keep both hands on the wheel at all times  just steer  given the instructor 146s insistence on keeping both hands on the wheel  something else i 146m not used to  i didn 146t much try to manually shift the automatic  that said  although things happened too quickly to pay much attention  the automatic seemed to always find the appropriate gear on its own  i certainly never felt the engine go soft as it awaited a downshift on the track the 3 146s chassis felt exquisitely balanced until very near its limit  where understeer took me into the aforementioned cones  the stability control was on  which no doubt helped maintain control  but i never felt it operate 151this seamlessness a good thing in itself  feedback from the pedals and seat of the pants was excellent  on the track the steering 146s weighting and precision were confidence inspiring   i 146d still like a quicker ratio 151i suspect the next 3 will offer the new 5 146s  147active steering 148 to resolve this issue  i felt thoroughly in control of the car  i 146ve mentioned before that the 3 feels better the harder it was driven  and on the track it was driven very hard  the tires were screaming most of the way around the track  with much skittering at the rear end through fast turn exits  this skittering normally would have been my cue to back off 151except the instructor said   147don 146t back off 148 so  aside from the chassis faithful communication of said skittering  the car felt very  very good  since the track was set up on a fairly smooth parking lot ride quality was not much of an issue  but from my other experiences in this car i can state that bmw is well ahead of the competition is maintaining ride quality even with its sport suspensions   jaguar and audi are both decidedly inferior in this regard  noise levels are very low  befitting a luxury car but not necessarily conducive to driving fun  thankfully the inline six makes wonderful noises 151it begs to be driven hard my main issue with this car remains  however  to whit  how much time will you spend at the track  in typical suburban driving the 3 series offers fewer thrills than many competitors  its like clark kent and superman  when there 146s no serious road work to be done  the 3 puts on the coat  tie  and glasses and relaxes  unless you regularly drive challenging roads you might have more fun elsewhere  of course  if you simply want to relax most of the time and save the thrills for sporadic trips to out of the way roads and racetracks  then sign right up b new performance oriented options for 2004  for 2004 bmw offers a couple of new performance oriented options  i have yet to sample either  but hope to in the near future  the first is a clutchless manual 151a true clutchless manual  not a manually shiftable automatic  while this transmission also has a fully automatic mode  its reason for being is lightning quick shifts in manual mode  these can be actuated using either steering wheel paddles or a manual like shifter  this transmission continues to be offered in the ultra high performance m3 for  2 400  but will be available in the regular 3  and new 5  for  1 500  as this is only  225 more than the automatic  it seems a no brainer for the driving enthusiast who doesn 146t like to use his or her left foot  i suspect the smg transmission must have disadvantages compared to an automatic  likely shift smoothness  or there would be no point in offering a regular automatic  i plan to test drive one as soon as possible to find out   the transmission becomes available in the 5 next march  i 146m not sure when it will be available in the 3 of more questionable value is the  147performance package 148  which was actually introduced last spring for the six speed 330 sedan and for 2004 is available with the automatic as well   for some reason it appears this package will not be available with the smg  but appearances can be deceiving  the m tuned sport suspension included in this package might well respond to my major issues with the 3  but lumped in with a modest ten horse boost to the engine  18 inch wheels  a body kit  and unique seats the price is  3 900   2 700 more than the sport package  assuming the revised suspension significantly sharpens up the car 146s handling  i wish it was available with only the usual sport package content  this would bring the price down considerably   pricing  the 3 series ranks with the mercedes c class as the most expensive car in its class   the baby jag is priced about as high  but heavy discounting and incentives take it out of the running for this  147prize 148  if you want technical excellence  you have to pay for it 151in the low 40s for a decently equipped 330  an audi a4 is a bit less expensive  but i found it an even more antiseptic driving experience under normal conditions  maybe it also comes alive on the track  i wouldn 146t count so much on it  the audi has a nicer interior but is slower and  with sport suspension  rides more harshly while still not handling as well  to save some significant bucks check out the infiniti g35  in some ways a more entertaining if less technically excellent car  the g35 146s interior is significantly lower in quality  the new acura tl  priced like the g35 in the low 30s  has a better driving position and design  to my eye  and a sweet v6  but cannot touch the above cars in handling  the all but forgotten lexus is 300 is the opposite  it pairs agile handling with a tight  cheap looking  even tacky interior  a saab 9 3 aero is priced like the japanese  after rebates  but offers more precise handling together with good ride quality  its interior quality is below the germans  a touch below the acura  and above the g35  a cadillac cts is priced nearly as high as the bmw 3  but offers nearly as much interior space as the 5  some don 146t care for its level of interior quality  but i don 146t find it too objectionable  if anything the 2004 cts comes too close to replicating the 3 146s chassis feel  as i 146d like more entertainment from it as well b last words  in the end there are no perfect cars in this class  the best car depends on your priorities in performance  handling  ride  refinement  interior room  interior quality  and styling  the bmw comes closer than any of the others to excelling on all fronts  but i cannot help wishing it were fitted with a more driver oriented  more interesting interior  quicker steering  and a more entertaining suspension  maybe the next 3 with an unbundled m tuned suspension and active steering i must admit that the 330 truly came alive on a track  the problem is i don 146t spend much of my time driving a car that hard  if you do  then my issues do not apply  i neglected to mention how well i did in the final  timed lap  heading into it  fresh from doing everything wrong on the instructional laps  i feared ending up dead last  well  out of twelve drivers i placed totally mid pack  sixth  if only i 146d had a few more laps to unlearn a few more of my bad habits 133 my reviews of related vehicles b a href content 116178587268 acura tl a b b a href content 77238210180 audi a4 3 0 a b b a href content 67800436356

449,auto, pros space and convenience  excellent space usage and beats all the competition in adjusting seats and the folding back seat is a dream come true ride  for being one of the largest vans in its class  it handles very well cons too many annoying glitches recalls  have had recalls on the automatic door  something about the possibility of it opening by itself while you are driving   never happen to me though  dashboard lights  all lights turned off one fine day  they did have a recall later  some recall in the exhaust system where they had to drill a hole in a pipe to avoid ice deposits in winter  one additional one that i can t remember recently my check engine light has been on and i have been to the dealership once and they could find out why  few hours after they turned it off it is on again   i will keep you updated on how i make out beware of the side view mirrors   extremely fragile and replacement is expensive   my neighbors kid pressed on the mirror and it popped off  what is worse is that the replacement cost me  130 for parts   labor  the central pivot snaps off and one has to get the complete unit including the power motor and casing replaced   i am trying to talk to honda about it but unless a lot of customers complain i think i am outta luck  just be careful about them   another friend of mine knocked it off his garage door and he paid a total of  175  automatic sliding door doesn t stop beyond a certain point if you place your hand or another object   typically if it is less than 12 24 inches from reaching the end of the opening  remote to unlock doesn t always work as advertised  double click to unlock often doesn t work and one has to click multiple times on the remote  i thought it was my problem but the guy at the dealership had the same issue     ,pro space convenience excellent space usage beat competition adjust seat fold back seat dream come true ride one largest van class candle well sons many annoy stitch recall recall automatic door something possibility open drive never happen though dashboard light light turn one fine day recall later recall exhaust system drill hole pipe avoid ice deposit winter one additional one remember recently check engine light leadership could find hours turn keep update make beware side view mirror extremely fragile replacement expensive neighbor kid press mirror pop worse replacement cost part labor central pilot snap one get complete unit include power motor cause replace try talk hand unless lot customers complain think gutta luck careful another friend mine knock garage door pay total automatic slide door stop beyond certain point place hand another object typically less inch reach end open remote clock always work advertise double click clock often work one click multiple time remote think problem guy leadership issue
450,camera, my plant recently settled on the sony fd92 digital camera for our plant to use  although against my better judgement  it turned out to be an okay purchase  whereas it doesn t meet my own standards  it does just fine for what it is needed for   they wanted the one with the floppy disks  i had to get a new camera for my job  of course  they put me in charge of choosing the right one  i settled on the kodak dc4800  this was a 3 1 megapixel camera with a lot of optical and digital zoom  it had a 16 mb memory and had a number of options of connectivity  serial  usb  etc  it was truly first class   the cadillac escalade of digital cameras  but my co workers didn t want that one  they wanted the sony fd92   only because it has floppy disks  it doesn t come close to having the resolution that the dc4800 has  it only has 1 5 mb  it its significantly larger and heavier than the dc4800  this was definately not in the same class   it was a honda crv of digital cameras   make due  so i had to suck it up and go with the compromise  but this camera has been okay  it takes surprisingly sharp photos of high quality  it has a really good optical zoom feature as well  i was able to take a clear photo of one of our pumps from 40 feet above  this is important when documenting damage in any of our industrial equipment   cracks  leaks  misalignments  etc  i still hold that the dc4800 is a better camera  but the sony has been no slouch b great features  the sony is relatively easy to use  it has a simple interface and is easy to navigate  you just switch between still mode  for taking pictures  and play mode  for viewing your photos  there s also a recording mode for short  and i mean  short  movies  but i don t use that much  there are a couple of other nice features like being able to include the time on the photo  this is good for documenting our photos  what is probably the best feature is the ability to switch between resolutions  this will allow you to better manage your disk memory as well as take the sharpest photos when you need them b the floppies aren t that great  although many people find them very convenient  i find that the floppy disks add an element of uncertainty in taking photos  most prominently  floppy disks break very easily  i would hate to have a disk break on me before i was able to download it onto my computer  furthermore  floppies are slower to access than a built in memory  they also make the camera that much heavier and expensive  the camera does come with a memory stick option   but for additional money  an 8 mb memory stick would be really helpful  i think  it just doesn t fit into our budget for this camera   could have gotten a cheaper camera  if all we were going to get was a 1 5 mb digital camera  we could have spent half the money  the sony fd92 cost us  579  the dc800 was  599  the extra  20 would have given us a technically superior camera  the main cost factor for the sony is the floppy drive  but as i stated before  i don t see much of a benefit  you still have to use a computer to process you photos  why would you spend twice as much money just because you re uncomfortable using a usb cable  doesn t make much sense to me but all things come out well in the end don t they  ,plant recently settle sonya ff digital camera plant use although better judgement turn okay purchase whereas meet standards fine need want one floppy disk get new camera job course put charge choose right one settle today megapixel camera lot optical digital room mb memory number option conductivity aerial us etc truly first class cadillac escapade digital camera co workers want one want sonya ff floppy disk come close resolution mb significantly larger heavier definitely class hand cry digital camera make due suck go compromise camera okay take surprisingly sharp photo high quality really good optical room feature well able take clear photo one pump feet important document damage industrial equipment crack lead misalignments etc still hold better camera sonya slough great feature sonya relatively easy use simple interface easy navigable switch still mode take picture play mode view photo also record mode short mean short move use much couple nice feature like able include time photo good document photo probably best feature ability switch resolutions allow better manage disk memory well take sharpest photo need flop great although many people find convenient find floppy disk add element uncertainty take photo prominently floppy disk break easily would hate disk break able download onto computer furthermore flop slower access build memory also make camera much heavier expensive camera come memory stick option additional money mb memory stick would really helpful think fit budget camera could get cheaper camera go get mb digital camera could spend half money sonya ff cost us extra would give us technically superior camera main cost factor sonya floppy drive state see much benefit still use computer process photo would spend twice much money uncomfortable use us cable make much sense things come well end
451,camera, the fuji was purchased for an inexpensive way of publishing pictures for ebay auctions  it was purchased on ebay from a dealer for a good price the unit is nothing fancy  but for the money has performed very well  with limited memory  2mb  it can hold about 6 pictures which is adequate for its intended purpose  to use personally  i d want a minimum of 8mb  the unit produces 1024x768 images which is adequate for on line use  for good photography  a higher resolution would be desirable  the unit is small and easy to use  it had a manual mode with white balance which allows good color correction for indoor lighting as with many digital cameras  have a supply of batteries available  a good alternative would be rechargeable alkaline or nicd batteries for continued use the only problem noted is that many ebay pictures need to be shot in the range between macro and regular  so a couple pictures are required to decide which is best at the 18 quot  distance  if using the camera for closer or farther photography  it works extremely well br br  ,full purchase expensive way publish picture bay auction purchase bay dealer good price unit nothing fancy money perform well limit memory mb hold picture adequate intend purpose use personally want minimum mb unit produce image adequate line use good photography higher resolution would desirable unit small easy use manual mode white balance allow good color correction indoor light many digital camera supply batteries available good alternative would rechargeable alkaline nice batteries continue use problem note many bay picture need shoot range micro regular couple picture require decide best quit distance use camera closer farther photography work extremely well br
452,auto, i owned a nissan sentra for almost five years before we purchased our quest  i never had any trouble with it at all  needless to say  i felt i should be loyal to nissan  as far as i am concerned  certain other car manufacturers owe me a car for the trouble i ve gone through with them  but my brother is a car salesman so i had to check out the dodge too  the nissan was   3 000 00 less with more features   like the rear audio  something the dodge does not have at this point  also  i was trading in the nissan sentra so dodge offered me   1 500 00 for it  nissan gave me   3 400 00 for the nissan sentra  that is quite a difference  i know that the dodge is a bit bigger but i think those few cubic feet are not worth the price difference  not to mention the peace of mind that i have with a nissan  the tv vcr unit that comes with the vehicle is wonderful for my two kids and we have taken three long car trips since we purchased it in may  the seats rearrange easily although it would be nice if the rear seat would come out completely  this is a wonderful vehicle for any type of family  it is roomy  quiet  and the ride is smooth br br  ,own nissan sentry almost five years purchase quest never trouble needle say felt loyal nissan far concern certain car manufacturers owe car trouble go brother car salesman check dodge nissan less feature like rear audit something dodge point also trade nissan sentry dodge offer nissan give nissan sentry quite difference know dodge bite bigger think cubic feet worth price difference mention peace mind nissan ver unit come vehicle wonderful two kiss take three long car trip since purchase may seat rearrange easily although would nice rear seat would come completely wonderful vehicle type family room quiet ride smooth br
453,camera, i was very keen to get into the world of digital photography  but this camera nearly turned me away from it for good i brought the mx 1200 as part of a deal with my new printer  the annoying little sales man assured me it was a  top little camera  and that i would be very happy with it  why did i listen to that stupid little man the mx 1200 is not a good buy despite its low price tag  sure it does have a few good points  but my personal opinion is that you should save for a couple more months and by something where the pros outweigh the cons i must admit that this is a very temping price  hey i bought it  and there are some situations where this camera might be the ideal purchase  for example  if you only want a camera to use around the home then the mx 1200 might just do the job  but if your thinking of taking it out into the field or on holiday then look elsewhere  this camera has a painfully short battery life  so if you plan on being to far from the nearest power outlet be prepared to spend a fortune on batteries  turning off the lcd screen will help to conserve power  but then  what s the point  the packaged software is just plain awful  it has minimal features and takes forever to load anything  so you may want to have a separate program like photoshop the other disappointing feature is the zoom  you can choose between normal or ridiculously close other letdowns include the small media card  most shots come out blurred  no usb  and there seems to be a high error or failure rate with the uploading one thing worth mentioning if your planing on getting the mx 1200 is that the only way to get really crisp pictures is to leave the flash on for every shot  i don t know why but it just works so heres the deal  if your looking for a first camera then this might be okay depending on what you want to do with it  but i do warn you that it might just as easily put you off the world of digital photography for good  ,keen get world digital photography camera nearly turn away good bring part deal new printer annoy little sales man assure top little camera would happy listen stupid little man good buy despite low price tag sure good point personal opinion save couple months something pro outweigh sons must admit tempt price hey buy situations camera might ideal purchase example want camera use around home might job think take field holiday look elsewhere camera painfully short battery life plan far nearest power outlet prepare spend fortune batteries turn lead screen help conserve power point package software plain awful minimal feature take forever load anything may want separate program like photoshop disappoint feature room choose normal ridiculously close letdowns include small media card shots come blur us seem high error failure rate unload one thing worth mention plant get way get really crisp picture leave flash every shoot know work deal look first camera might okay depend want warn might easily put world digital photography good
454,auto, i own a 1999 model and it has been in for constant repairs  it has a very stiff ride  very uncomfortable  handles so   so  and has terrible quality control problems  mine has been in for numerous electrical problems  doors openning on their own  failed electronic door locks  windows  cd changer replaced 3 times  etc  the 4wd shift lever vibrates so loud when accelerating that you can t hear the radio over it  i have had it back to the dealership 3 times and they refuse to do anything about it  you also have to change the transmission fluid every 18 000 miles which is stupid  the engine is sluggish and the transmission is geared too high  the only good thing about this vehicle is the brakes have lasted a long time  in my opinion the toyota 4 runner and ford explorer is a much better rig   this is the same vehicle as the isuzu rodeo and the honda dealers don t like working on them  ,model constant repair stiff ride uncomfortable candle terrible quality control problems mine numerous electrical problems doors open fail electronic door lock windows change replace time etc shift lever vibrate loud accelerate hear radio back leadership time refuse anything also change transmission fluid every miles stupid engine sluggish transmission fear high good thing vehicle rake last long time opinion tooth runner ford explorer much better fig vehicle isuzu ride hand dealers like work

456,camera, before i say a thing  i must thank my dad for getting me this schweet camara for my b day last year  it is the best thing that has ever happened to me yet it has one major problem to start off  the canon powershoot is one of the coolest things ever  it is small  durable and the pictures are crisp and clear once you put them onto your computer let me just say that if your lookin  to take pics that you will want to have physically to show your friends this is not the camara for you  if you want to make a handy lookin  web site or e mail your pics to fellow friends this is the camara for you the powershoot as many many many high tec features that i wont get into this very moment  the camara has about four settings and they all take brilliant photos  what i love about this camara is that you can actually see the picture as soon as you take it  and if you don t like it  than you can immediatly delete it and start over  the camara also has a great panoramic feature where you can take two pictures side by side  then patch them together for a panoramic wide lense view awesom  the problem with the camara is 1  you have to load up on assecories since you are not supplied with them when you first by the camara  it comes with one 8 megabit chip that can hold about ten pictures at one time  no case  no strap  and no rechargable battery or battery charger just one battery that goes out very quickly  so  these assecories add up to about 500 dollars extra  thats right  i paid about this much for a batter charger  2 rechargable batteries  a case and a new 42 meg memory card that held about 100 exposures aside from this set back  another good quality about this camara is that it can take pictures in various sizes  shapes and even color s  yep  thats right you have the option of taking your pictures in a black and white color  cool huh  and when they are loaded into your compuuter  it looks as if they are taken from the olden days cool a flash is built into this camara along with an amazing digital zoom  i think its an 8x digital zoom but i m no positively sure  maybe it s 4 but anyway i was at a baseball game taking pictures and the digital zoom can get so close that it took perfect action shots of all of my favorite ball players  i love it this little camara has so much to offer  about 50 things on top of the ones i just talked about  this camara really is worth the money  you wont be dissapointed at all  if you get one digital camara this year  definatly make this the one  i will not let you down br br  ,say thing must thank dad get sweet camera day last year best thing ever happen yet one major problem start canon powershoot one coolest things ever small unable picture crisp clear put onto computer let say look take pick want physically show friends camera want make handy look web site mail pick fellow friends camera powershoot many high ten feature wont get moment camera four settings take brilliant photo love camera actually see picture soon take like immediately delete start camera also great panorama feature take two picture side side patch together panorama wide sense view awesom problem camera load assecories since supply first camera come one megabit chip hold ten picture one time case strap rechargable battery battery charge one battery go quickly assecories add dollars extra right pay much matter charge rechargable batteries case new meg memory card hold exposures aside set back another good quality camera take picture various size shape even color yep right option take picture black white color cool hut load computer look take older days cool flash build camera along amaze digital room think digital room positively sure maybe anyway baseball game take picture digital room get close take perfect action shots favorite ball players love little camera much offer things top ones talk camera really worth money wont disappoint get one digital camera year defiantly make one let br
457,camera, jvc has always had a good reputation for quality  but maybe this is their first digital camera  i ve owned the camera for only one month  but i have spent twice as much time reading the manual as using the camera the camera is much too complicated for the average user  to learn how to use all its functions would take me at least 6 months of full time schooling  the design is simply overkill  far to complicated for the everyday user  instruction manual is very poor  in some cases totally ambiguous and unfathomable  also  the controls are poorly designed  the so called  power dial   which is the main control  is cumbersome and poorly designed  the power dial  the zoom control  the mode control are are located so close together  that it s very difficult to avoid changing the mode or switching the power dial to another function  erasing photos from the smart media card is very cumbersome  and if you happen to let the card get full  it becomes virtually impossible  the film copy mode  for shooting negatives or slides  is very poorly explained in the manual  and even when you understand how to do it  the challenge is considerable and the results are poor having two lcd panels  one on the back and one on the top of the camera  is a pain  also  many functions are much too slow  also  outdoor daylight  it s almost impossible to determine whether the picture has been taken or not  if there is a beep  i ve never heard it yet  the flash is annoying  because it s on by default and you have to turn it off before taking each picture  a royal pain that is it s an attractive looking camera  but let s be realistic function is beauty  in terms of function this camera is very ugly  if you ask about shutter lag who knows  you never when when the camera has taken the picture also  photo quality is not nearly as good as my canon powershot a20  which has only 2 1 mega  this camera is best for professionals because the average person will go crazy trying to learn how to use it and putting up with its deficiencies  ,always good reputation quality maybe first digital camera own camera one month spend twice much time read manual use camera camera much complicate average user learn use function would take least months full time choose design simply overall far complicate everyday user instruction manual poor case totally ambiguous unfathomable also control poorly design call power dial main control cumbersome poorly design power dial room control mode control locate close together difficult avoid change mode twitch power dial another function ease photo smart media card cumbersome happen let card get full become virtually impossible film copy mode shoot negative side poorly explain manual even understand challenge considerable result poor two lead panel one back one top camera pain also many function much slow also outdoor daylight almost impossible determine whether picture take never hear yet flash annoy default turn take picture royal pain attractive look camera let realistic function beauty term function camera ugly ask shutter law know never camera take picture also photo quality nearly good canon powershot meg camera best professional average person go crazy try learn use put deficiencies
458,camera, i purchased my toshiba pdr m 25 mainly because of the features for the price  i wanted an optical zoom and a high enough resolution picture to print well  the toshiba seemed to fit the bill the camera takes good outdoor photographs with bright  vibrant  accurate color reproduction  there is a problem however with the lag between snapping the picture and when the picture is recorded  i have gotten several shots where the people i was photographing saw me  snap  the shot so they moved  the photo i got was of them moving   not the posed shot i intended to get  this is also a problem when trying to take a shot of a moving object  such as one of the deer that roams our neighborhood low light photos come out grainy   like using a film camera in low light when the flash does not fire  even with the flash on you must be close to the subject to take an indoor or outdoor evening picture  in toshiba s defense they state that the flash is for pictures up to 8 2 feet away from reading reviews on several other digital cameras i think this must be a common complaint i have read several complaints about short battery life and i will agree with some clarification  when using the camera indoors and reviewing the pictures on the lcd screen i have had the batteries last only 10 or 12 pictures  conversely when taking pictures outside i have taken in excess of 40 pictures on 1 set of alkaline batteries  i have read where rechargeable nimh will last much longer than this  i have ordered some so i will soon know the camera seems to be more sensitive to movement than my 35mm nikon  probably because of shutter speed knowing what i do now i would check out some of the other cameras a little closer before i purchased this one again it may be that the short comings of this camera are typical of digital cameras in this price range  ,purchase toshiba per mainly feature price want optical room high enough resolution picture print well toshiba seem fit bill camera take good outdoor photograph bright vagrant accurate color reproduction problem however law snap picture picture record get several shots people photographic saw snap shoot move photo get move pose shoot intend get also problem try take shoot move object one deer room neighborhood low light photo come grain like use film camera low light flash fire even flash must close subject take indoor outdoor even picture toshiba defense state flash picture feet away read review several digital camera think must common complaint read several complaints short battery life agree clarification use camera indoors review picture lead screen batteries last picture conversely take picture outside take excess picture set alkaline batteries read rechargeable nigh last much longer order soon know camera seem sensitive movement mm union probably shutter speed know would check camera little closer purchase one may short come camera typical digital camera price range
459,auto, our local chevrolet dealer invited us to take a new 2003 all wheel drive express van for the weekend  we currently have a 2000 all wheel drive astro van that we use as both a floral delivery vehicle and personnel vehicle for vacations  etc  we where thinking about moving up to a full size van  our current astro van has ls trim  8 passenger  rear ac  and in general is pretty well loaded with other options  we wanted the new express van to be equipped about the same  which for the most part this one was we never got to drive the express long enough to get used to the bigger and much longer size but i don 146t think it would take very long  i think i could get used to a much roomier van  there was plenty of legroom in the front  especially on the passenger side and even the back seats had plenty of legroom for our teen age kids  just as our astro  the express was an 8 passenger but the big difference was there was much more room behind the back seat  i assume if you move up to a   ton you get another seat  the seats look like they would be very easy to remove if you need to it drives like a dream  there is plenty of power and the four wheel disk brakes stop very smooth and straight  it handled really good on our local two lanes  snake like roads  and on the open highway there was plenty of power to spare  i like the way the new express is designed similar to the silvered pickups  i also really liked the left side rear door  a real convenience  and the rear panel doors will swing open 180 degrees  which would make it really easy to load large items such as furniture  on the astro you have to unlatch the doors to do this now for the con 146s  as i said  we wanted the express to be equipped similar to the astro and here is where it falls short  there are no storage compartments over the rear wheel wells and the rear seat backs don 146t fold down  we have gotten used to these features on the astro  we fold down the rear seats and sometimes stack stuff on top of them  and the rear storage compartments are always used to store small items that we don 146t want rolling all over the van  there is no assist handle on the passenger side of the express and this makes it really hard to get in  as the express is somewhat taller than the astro  i also noticed that the front doors do not open wide enough  with the ls trim you get some rather large  hard plastic  pockets on the door and i was constantly getting my leg stuck against them when i exited the van  there is also no twilight sentinel on the headlights  which almost every other gm vehicle has  the van is also not trimmed out as nice as the astro  i would expect the ls package to add more carpeting on the front and side door panels but they are left all plastic all in all gm has done a very good job redesigning the express but they need to put more astro like features on it if they expect to attract current astro owners  because of these missing features i think we will wait a couple of years before we move up  maybe gm will get their act together by then aug  8  2003 i was reading a press release and chevrolet has added assist handles on the passanger side for 2004  ,local chevrolet dealer invite us take new wheel drive express van weekend currently wheel drive gastro van use flora delivery vehicle personnel vehicle vacation etc think move full size van current gastro van trim

460,camera, the sony mavica was one of the first digital cameras to make it to the mass market  and though it may be an  early bloomer  it is a pretty good one the mavica is sort of like my old  68 volkswagen  anyone can drive it  it will endure lots of punishment and screw ups  but don t expect ferrari style power  i bought the mavica for two reasons  to enter the world of digital photography  and i loved the idea of just using 3 5  floppies as the storage medium instead of all those proprietary cable and chip gizmos simple is simple it is easy to use and it has not let us down yet  it is really finicky about light settings there isn t much of a fudge factor there  as with all digital cameras  but once you get the exposure setting right you re in business  the main problem with the mavica is that the picture is about like what you d expect from a polaroid print  you can make out what the people look like  but don t hold your breath waiting to see if national geographic will buy your images  for family stuff you can share on the internet with the family  it is fine  the main plus with these cameras  aside from the internet stuff  is that you don t have to mess with film and developing costs and you can re do any goofs  as a long time print photographer  that makes things really nice  and the neato thing about the mavica  again  is the advantage a 3 5 floppy gives you over all those smart cards and other geeky doo dads  if you re at grandma s and you wanna see what you ve got on the computer screen  just take out the diskette and slap it into grandma s computer  voila  it s working   p s  of course it helps if your grandma has made it into the cyberworld and actually has a  puter  ,sonya mavra one first digital camera make mass market though may early loom pretty good one mavra sort like old volkswagen anyone drive endure lot punishment screw expect ferri style power buy mavra two reason enter world digital photography love idea use flop storage medium instead proprietary cable chip gizmos simple simple easy use let us yet really finicky light settings much judge factor digital camera get exposure set right business main problem mavra picture like expect polaroid print make people look like hold breath wait see national geographic buy image family stuff share internet family fine main plus camera aside internet stuff mess film develop cost goods long time print photographer make things really nice neat thing mavra advantage floppy give smart card weeks days grand anna see get computer screen take diskette slap grand computer voila work course help grand make cyberworld actually peter

465,camera, this is my first review  so if i ve missed anything out  please don t hesitate to leave a comment   i ll try to answer any questions  i was looking for reviews on the olympus mju 300 digital camera and found none  so thought i d set the ball rolling  so here goes  n b  i live in the uk  so some aspects of this review might not apply  but i ll try to keep it as product related as possible i had decided to buy a digital camera because i am moving to france for a year and wanted to record my experiences there  i started off by just browsing the different cameras in my price range  around  300    480  i was immediately drawn to the mju 300 because it looked so sleek and attractively designed  especially compared to some of the nikons  which were far bulkier  having shopped around  i finally paid  243  including a 10  student discount  us  390  to be honest  i was more in the market for a point and shoot camera than anything particularly professional  but i did some research to make sure i was getting the best spec  for my money  i was particularly impressed by the zoom quality  the movie mode and the generally sharp  clear pictures it gave me when i was trying it out and my opinion has not changed in the weeks i have had the camera  i bought an upgrade for the picture card and can now store 160 pictures on the camera at a time  which is plenty for me   i didn t feel the 16mb card was enough  i found setting up the camera simple to say the least and the battery only took 2 hours to fully charge from new  they even included a continental adapter so i can use it easily in france  we have different electricity plugs here  how convenient  having taken my pictures  i then set up the software on my computer  many of my friends have had problems transferring their photos from their camera to the pc  but the software provided was excellent  simple  easy to use and yet still powerful  i have  as yet  had no problems transferring  editing   printing images  it is wise to read the manual properly first as olympus use symbols for different functions and commands  so it s a bit confusing if you don t learn what they mean first  you get the hang of it really quickly  however  and after that it s no problem  my one complaint would be that there was no case provided and i have had difficulty finding one to fit   you need something to protect the screen from scratches and surely it wouldn t cost much to provide a basic  cheap pouch  especially as they even went to the trouble of providing 24 months free cover with www yellowtag com  the camera itself  however  has been wonderful   it looks great  is easy to use and takes excellent photos  i would recommend without hesitation  ,first review miss anything please hesitate leave comment try answer question look review polypus digital camera find none think set ball roll go live aspects review might apply try keep product relate possible decide buy digital camera move france year want record experience start browse different camera price range around immediately draw look sleek attractively design especially compare unions far bulkier stop around finally pay include student discount us honest market point shoot camera anything particularly professional research make sure get best speck money particularly impress room quality movie mode generally sharp clear picture give try opinion change weeks camera buy upgrade picture card store picture camera time plenty feel mb card enough find set camera simple say least battery take hours fully charge new even include continental adapt use easily france different electricity plug convenient take picture set software computer many friends problems transfer photo camera pp software provide excellent simple easy use yet still powerful yet problems transfer edit print image wise read manual properly first polypus use symbols different function command bite confuse learn mean first get hang really quickly however problem one complaint would case provide difficulty find one fit need something protect screen scratch surely cost much provide basic cheap pouch especially even go trouble provide months free cover www yellow com camera however wonderful look great easy use take excellent photo would recommend without hesitation
466,camera, digital cameras have come a long way since i got my first one in 1992  back then  they were black and white  grayscale in computer terms  but black and white in photographic terms  had poor resolution  were expensive  were slow  and transferring images to a pc was an ordeal  this camera shows just how far the medium has come in a bit over a decade the visioneer mx200 is an entry level digital camera  while it lacks the features found in more expensive cameras  it still boasts a 2 megapixel resolution  which is sufficient to produce clear  sharp pictures up to 8 by 10 inches  it sports an lcd display  which is de rigeur for digital cameras these days  it has 8mb of internal memory  which in theory can hold up to 66 pictures in  normal  resolution  however  in  super  resolution  it can hold seven  there are also three intermediate resolutions with intermediate capacities   super  resolution can be thought of as normal resolution compared to the better digital cameras on the market  so if you want clear  sharp prints that can survive cropping or enlarging to 8 by 10  then you better stick to the maximum resolution  which is 2048 1536 although the memory issue seems like a limitation  the camera supports smartmedia cards  a 128mb card cost me  39 with a  10 rebate  29 net  and that brought the capacity up to 145  super  resolution pictures  if you want more capacity  you can buy several cards  use lower resolution  or just upload the pictures to your computer more frequently  if you are satisfied with 4 by 6 snapshots or plan to use the camera for web photos only  then the internal memory at normal resolution should be adequate  and a similar smartmedia card can give you about 900 photos the camera comes with a built in flash  settings for white balance and flash  including an automatic one for each  a macro setting  and a setting for portraits  landscapes  and night scenes  as well as a self timer  the camera can also be used in pc mode as a pc camera with applications such as microsoft netmeeting  the camera can record video clips up to one minute long  albeit without sound there is also a 3 1 digital zoom  as with many digital cameras  a digital zoom is a poor substitute for an optical one  i read elsewhere that since the number of pixels in the ccd is fixed  the camera must make use of an algorithm to map zoomed pixels onto the ccd  and unless the zoom amount is an even multiple  you end up losing quality  likewise  if you decide to just crop the picture later  you will lose quality since editing a jpeg and saving it as a jpeg causes loss of resolution  needless to say you cannot find analog zoom on any cameras in this price range as of this writing  however  i did find that photos taken without the zoom appeared to be of better quality the camera comes with a case  strap  usb cable  video cable  for tv hookup  software  instructions  and dead batteries  customer support acknowledged that many users reported that the batteries were dead after only two or three pictures  mine did not last so long and the camera told me to change my batteries before i took a single picture according to the documentation  the camera should be used with alkaline batteries only  in another area  it says that it comes with alkaline or nimh batteries   it comes with alkalines  in yet another section  it states that alkaline or nimh batteries should be used  alkaline batteries are not very useful in this camera  if you use them  you will need to keep the lcd screen off  and you will run out of batteries after a dozen pictures or so  if you leave the camera on by mistake  it happened to me once when the button got pushed even though it was in the case  then you might get only two pictures from a set of alkaline batteries  i bought a set of nimh batteries and a charger for  5 99 and the camera has been doing fine ever since  the battery life rating i gave referred to the batteries supplied or any aa alkaline batteries used to replace them  if you try to take flash pictures with alkaline batteries  be prepared to turn the camera off afterwards to let the batteries rest before you can use it again the camera accepts an ac adapter  but there is no mention of it in the documentation  the visioneer website mentions that you can use a 3v 1000ma converter  it does not say the plug size or that it needs to be a converter with dc output  however  once the support person gave me the model number of an adapter from radio shack that works  i was able to find out most of what i need to know   such adapters come with multiple plugs or entitle the user to a plug that fits the unit in the case of radio shack  other parts related to the functionality of the camera are lacking in the documentation  for example  the explanation of the status led says that you can take a picture when it is a solid green  but you must wait when it is blinking  however  it does not say why the camera does not work when the led is amber  i will update this section if i ever find that out the documentation says that the camera features  advanced stepless digital zoom  superior adz  but there is no explanation of what adz tm  is  the instructions for the preset modes neglect to tell you how to get to them  you must first set the dial to pre set  this may be obvious when you have the camera and are used to it  but if you read the manual ahead of time  or without the camera in front of you  it makes no sense the troubleshooting section of the documentation is far from comprehensive  and if you have enough savvy to know how to check the batteries  there is a battery level indicator on the screen  but it s obviously useless if your batteries are completely dead  turn the unit off and make sure that the memory card is in correctly  it s of little use customer support is fair  there is an on line web based system that tells you much of what is left out of the manual  but not nearly enough  when i spoke to the customer support folks  they were not able to tell me much beyond what is available on line  what they did tell me in some cases  if accurate  did not instill confidence  in the case of the ac adapter  i was told that all they know is what was in their database and it came from a customer who tried it and it worked  when i told them that what the website said was inadequate  they did not seem concerned with updating it when it comes to getting photos to your computer  the task is painless  if you load the drivers from the cd  then windows will detect the camera as it does with any plug and play device  the camera will then appear as an external drive  and you can copy pictures using standard windows tools  i did not test this with a mac  but it should work  the camera will organize photos in folders by date  there will be a subdirectory for each date on which photos were taken  and photos within the directory will have a name composed of the date and a serial number  07280001 jpg would be the first photo taken on 7 28th  the camera also comes with  digital camera utility  software that allows you to select and download photos  however  the software is not rich enough in features to warrant any sort of praise  nor did i feel that i really needed it  if you already have software for viewing and editing images  it s not an issue when i got my first digital camera  i was beta testing it for logitech  it was the first consumer oriented digital camera on the market  it lacked features  and could not handle many contrast situations  for example  photographing african americans was not possible if you wanted facial features to be discernable  by contrast  in high resolution  this camera will produce images and prints up to 8 by 10 inches that rival that of a good  but not professional quality  35 mm camera  that s assuming that you do not zoom  and you compose the picture properly and use the proper settings  however  the default settings will work as well as one would would expect from many cameras with automated settings  and the lcd display will give you an idea of what to expect if you use other settings the bottom line is that it s a cheap camera that takes good pictures in the camera s most basic mode  it will not compare in quality to a high end digital camera  but if you are used to an inexpensive 35mm camera and wish to go digital  this should be more than adequate  be prepared to spend a bit more on memory  30 50  batteries and charger  6 30  and an ac adapter  12 20  ultimately  if you want the convenience of longer usage  the ability to leave it plugged into your pc  and the ability to store more photos  the price can easily double  so check out whether more expensive models come with these features as standard before you decide if this is the camera for you  that s especially true if you may need to buy an aftermarket image editing tool that may come for free with a more expensive camera  ,digital camera come long way since get first one back black white grayscale computer term black white photographic term poor resolution expensive slow transfer image pp ordeal camera show far

470,auto, i bought my vw beetle last march  i chose it because it was relatively inexpensive  i no longer needed a  quot family car quot   we have another one for that  and i wanted something amusing and distinctive  but at the same time reliable and safe  and the beetle s safety rating  for a car its size  was impressive  finally  i often drive into new york city  where having a car that has a short wheelbase is definitely helpful as one looks for a place to park on the street since i wanted the car is bright blue i had to wait two weeks for it to arrive from mexico  otherwise  however  i bought the standard 2 0 liter gasoline powered model with no extras  i open the windows with a crank  if you can imagine that  transmission is manual  since the engine is much more zippy that way  avoiding a lot of extras kept the price way down so soon i will have it all paid off  when i drove it out of the lot i was delighted with it  and now that 9 months have passed i can tell you that it has been a pleasure to have this car  nothing has gone wrong  and since the car comes with 2 years  or 20 000 miles  of free service  i have not had to spend a penny on it other than for gas  the dealer  barry in newington ct  has been superb  in that they have have been solicitous even after selling the car  and helpful at every turn then again  every car has drawbacks  i suppose  my major complaint with the beetle 2000 is that vw won t supply a radio with built in compact disk player  the best that i could get was a player in the trunk  which is nowhere as convenient  i hope they fix that in future models  other things they should fix in future models  there is no way to leave the car with an attendant at a public garage and give him the key while keeping the trunk and the glove compartment secure  one key opens all  and once in the car an inner latch opens the trunk  also  in the winter when there is snow and ice on the windshield  the windshield wiper tends to lift in the center  leaving an area poorly swept  in addition  this car is not meant for someone who wanders off the main road  ground clearance is extremely low so any obstacle hits the bottom  finally  i am glad that i got a car with good gas mileage considering the price rise over the past six months   however i should point out that the mileage i have been getting is 27 miles per gallon    pretty good but not the same as what the sticker said  31 miles  i didn t get the diesel  which has a lot better mileage  because i drive in many places where there are few or no stations that carry diesel  especially at night  this may not be the right car if you have to drive around with a big family  but for occasional back seat occupancy  it is remarkably comfortable in the back  and the way the seat moves forward makes it easy to get in br br  ,buy beetle last march choose relatively expensive longer need quit family car quit another one want something amuse distinctive time reliable safe beetle safety rat car size impressive finally often drive new york city car short wheelbase definitely helpful one look place park street since want car bright blue wait two weeks arrive mexico otherwise however buy standard later gasoline lower model extra open windows crank imagine transmission manual since engine much happy way avoid lot extra keep price way soon pay drive lot delight months pass tell pleasure car nothing go wrong since car come years miles free service spend penny gas dealer barry lexington superb solicitor even sell car helpful every turn every car drawback suppose major complaint beetle supply radio build compact disk player best could get player trunk nowhere convenient hope fix future model things fix future model way leave car attendant public garage give key keep trunk glove compartment secure one key open car inner latch open trunk also winter snow ice windshield windshield wipe tend lift center leave area poorly sweep addition car mean someone wander main road grind clearance extremely low obstacle hit bottom finally glad get car good gas mileage consider price rise past six months however point mileage get miles per gallon pretty good stick say miles get diese lot better mileage drive many place station carry diese especially night may right car drive around big family occasional back seat occupancy remarkably comfortable back way seat move forward make easy get br

474,camera, this was our first foray into digital camera s and i can t say how much we love this camera it is extremely easy to use  you have three options for quality of picture  the higher quality the fewer amount of pictures the camera will hold  you can purchase additional reusable memory cards so that you don t have to download your pictures to be able to take more it also has the l e d  display  i don t know why you would buy a digital camera without a display  it also comes with a flash the one bad point of the 780c is that it does not have zoom  most digital cameras do not come with zoom  the reason being is that you can enhance the pictures once they are downloaded on the computer  a zoom would be nice built into the camera but i would not let this fact stop you from buying this camera it seems durable  we have taken it to the beach  stuffed it in suitcases  and found our two year old bouncing it on the floor  i purchased this camera on line for under 200  look for a deal on this camera and you will probably find one  i would recommend this camera to anyone as a good starter camera br br  ,first forty digital camera say much love camera extremely easy use three option quality picture higher quality fewer amount picture camera hold purchase additional reliable memory card download picture able take also display know would buy digital camera without display also come flash one bad point room digital camera come room reason enhance picture download computer room would nice build camera would let fact stop buy camera seem unable take beach stuff suitcase find two year old bound floor purchase camera line look deal camera probably find one would recommend camera anyone good start camera br
475,camera, i m going to be honest with you all  i do not know much about computers or the equipment that inevitably comes with them  i don t really understand all of the technical stuff  but i can make a well informed opinion based on my results  because  as they say   quot seeing is believing quot  my parents first bought this digital camera last summer for their business  of course  seeing a new toy  i wanted to play with it  the only problem i had was that i did not have the directions  luckily this was not a problem as sony made this product so easy to use that instructions were not necessary to perform its most basic functions  while i was pleasantly surprised at how easy this digital camera was to use i could not have been more shocked as to its overall quality  not having a scanner  and hoping to use specific pictures for a possible web page  we decided to simply use the camera to take a picture of our pictures  the quality of these images  pictures of pictures  is great  except for the flash mark  which can easily be edited out  there was almost no indication that it was taken with a digital camera  while some people may not be surprised by this at all  i was shocked because previous pictures i had seen taken with a digital camera were grainy and it was obvious that they were taken with a digital camera  i would definitely recommend this product to anyone considering a digital camera for either their business or personal use br br  ,go honest know much computers equipment inevitably come really understand technical stuff make well inform opinion base result say quit see believe quit parent first buy digital camera last summer business course see new toy want play problem directions luckily problem sonya make product easy use instructions necessary perform basic function pleasantly surprise easy digital camera use could shock overall quality scan hop use specific picture possible web page decide simply use camera take picture picture quality image picture picture great except flash mark easily edit almost indication take digital camera people may surprise shock previous picture see take digital camera grain obvious take digital camera would definitely recommend product anyone consider digital camera either business personal use br
476,camera, the fuji finepix a101 is a serious tool for making clear concise photography  it has the power and efficiency to handle the demand of professional photographers needs  while it puts the pleasure of simply great photographing back in the hands of amateur photographers i had originally intended to purchase the finepix as an inexpensive camera for my wife to use  my wife is not a photographer  however i just showed her which button to push and she now takes perfect photos the camera offers a duality in perspective of photo capabilities  it has a fully automatic range of settings for flash and sensory which is necessary for my wife s photo pleasure  the second perspective is that it is a completely flexible camera in the way a photographer can manually set the camera to perform under different ambience and intensities  it is after all a 100  35mm camera and senses at a range of 1 2  7 square pixel length ccd or otherwise known as 1 3 mega pixels  i can set these sensory options to make photos of up to 1280x960  fine  or 640x480  normal  pixels  this camera can also sequence up to 20 seconds of video without sound  one of the greatest benefits about the finepix is it s size in conjunction to it s power  the finepix does a heavy weight job of taking up to 200 high quality normal photos using 3volt nimh batteries and a 64mb smart media card  while weighing in at only 145 grams  5oz here are just a few more of the benefits of the finepix a101 200 normal quality photos which are worth five rolls of 35mm film  this camera has a power saving feature which will more than amply allow for this feature to produce even more photos of a smaller pixel length  the finepix auto or manual focus range is from 2 6 ft to infinity with either the automatic or manual 6 modes of white balance  it has an automatic or manually set flash built in the finepix is one of the smallest cameras in the world  which includes a 1 6 inch  55 000 pixels  color lcd monitor  this monitor zooms in for close up photography the finepix connects to most pc computers under windows via usb port to download your photos to an online photo developer lab or to email them to friends the finepix comes with simple software   and easy to read manuals the finepix shoots up to 20 seconds of video  no sound  the finepix can be used as a web cam for online video conferencing the finepix is the most powerful camera in its digital camera size bracket 3 9 x 2 5 x 1 6 inches i am a nonsmoker  but as most tee shirts and sweaters sometimes come with that smoking pocket for cigarettes than what better a place for this small and powerful camera now when someone seeing the bulge in that smoking pocket  asks me for a cigarette i pull out the finepix and take a snapshot of a disappointed would be smoker what is really smoking about the finepix is it s low retail price  and cost effectiveness as a digital camera in comparison to the cost and quality of the other brands there are very many different iso accessories that will fit the camera  which means they are all not necessarily manufactured by fuji  although fuji does have everything you will need to get an inexpensive start with the best small camera on the digital camera market  you will find that other camera manufacturers make only proprietary accessories for their cameras  and other accessories won t fit their cameras  but that s never a problem with a fuji finepix camera i had originally purchased the fuji finepix as an easy camera for the wife to use  but now instead i prefer it to the heavier power models i own  it has the power to do the job  and the size that makes taking it with you easier i am totally happy with the fuji finepix a101 camera   ,full finepix serious

477,auto, i bought my new 04 special edition jeep grand cherokee only about 2 weeks ago and have only 1000 miles on it  so far  everything is great and i look forward to driving it every day  the special edition offers a nicer trim package with color side moldings  no plastic on the outside  a better stereo  fog lights  and an upper console information system  gas mileage  temperature  compass  etc  i live in atlanta so i opted for the six cylinder engine with two wheel drive  i m no speed demon and i don t intend on getting my new jeep dirty by going off road  i love the way the cherokee handles on the roads  it s tight and very responsive  the engine is very quiet along with the overall ride of the jeep  i was very impressed by the low wind noise i was expecting to get on my first test drive  all the controls are at easy reach and easy to read and operate  i like the delay feature on the rear window wiper  my last suv only had on and off  the stereo has an amazing sound that fills up the cabin with extreme clarity  it makes my drive time more enjoyable  the cherokee has plenty of storage compartments to offer and i especially like that they put the full size spare tire on the inside of the vehicle so in case of a flat  you re not outside trying to down reel a dirty tire from underneath  both the rear hatch and glass open separately which can be a blessing when hauling larger items  one thing i don t care for is the way you have to pull up the back seat in order to fold down the back rest so it lays flat  you have to take the headrests off  find a place to put them for a moment  pull up the seat cushion  pull down the back rest  and then place the headrests in their small slots to be stored  jeep could have taken a lesson from some of the other domestic engineers and figured a way to pull one lever and have everything move forward and lay flat in one motion  the only other complaint i have is where the window and door lock controls are placed on the door panels  i felt it would be easier if they could place them further toward the dash so it would be easier to operate  other than the two complaints i have listed above  i can t find anything i don t like about my new jeep  the gas mileage was a bit better then what i expected so i really don t have any complaints in that area  this is an suv so if gas consumption is an issue for you  don t buy any suv  like i said  i am very impressed with the mileage i am receiving so far  as you can tell by now  i am no serious review writer but i can tell you that i am very happy with my new jeep  i hope to get many years of enjoyment out of it  ,buy new special edition deep grand cherokee weeks ago miles far everything great look forward drive every day special edition offer nicer trim package color side hold plastic outside better sterno fog light upper console information system gas mileage temperature compass etc live atlanta often six cylinder engine two wheel drive speed demon intend get new deep dirty go road love way cherokee candle roads tight responsive engine quiet along overall ride deep impress low wind noise expect get first test drive control easy reach easy read operate like delay feature rear window wipe last sun sterno amaze sound fill cabin extreme clarity make drive time enjoyable cherokee plenty storage compartments offer especially like put full size spare tire inside vehicle case flat outside try feel dirty tire underneath rear watch glass open separately bless haul larger items one thing care way pull back seat order fold back rest lay flat take headdress find place put moment pull seat cushion pull back rest place headdress small shots store deep could take lesson domestic engineer figure way pull one lever everything move forward lay flat one motion complaint window door lock control place door panel felt would easier could place toward dash would easier operate two complaints list find anything like new deep gas mileage bite better expect really complaints area sun gas consumption issue buy sun like say impress mileage receive far tell serious review writer tell happy new deep hope get many years enjoyment
478,camera, i love almost everything about this camera  i have owned mine for over one year and i have few complaints  and high praise let me start by saying that i rate and have expectations from the camera relative to what is it  meaning  i would not buy a geo metro and expect a bmw  that being said  for a 1 5 mega pixel camera i find the picture quality excellent  i have reproduced many of the photos on print i have taken through my local printshop  the printed quality of the digital photo prints rivals most non digital prints i was able to compare at the shop on many occasions  there are enough features in the camera to allow you to customize your photos and picture taking style  you will not feel as if you are simply at the mercy of the camera  the auto shutter feature is a great way to capture action shots where you can not simply say  ok  hold it right there  you can activate the slow shutter mode  with or without the use of the flash  to create cool effects such as motion blurring the 3x optical zoom gives a feel of a conventional camera and is very useful  while many camera have higher level digital zooms  you will often find the you wind up seeing what the camera thinks the distant object looks like through the use of refined digital interpolation  sometimes it is good sometimes not  an optical zoom is just that  optical  through the lens  not electronics  although only 3x  you will find it a true representation of the object photographed  the macro feature on the camera will let you focus down to a few cm of an object  using the macro you can photograph things as fine as the fine print of a newspaper with ease the digital lcd screen is a perfect size and high resolution  but you will find it is nearly useless in bright sunlight  in these cases  using the built in viewfinder will yield equally good photos the controls are located perfectly  however some buttons are a bit small and you might find it easy to fat finger a button from time to time  all silver clouds have dark linings  or is that the other way around  anyway there are a few downfalls the auto timer on the camera does not allow you to modify the same settings that you can when you are taking pictures normally  i have found this a minor problem and have taken some of the best remote photos in my life with this camera if you have a very sharp eye you will notice that photos tend to have a slight fisheye perspective  if you were to take a photo of an object with perfectly straight parallel lines from top to bottom at the furthest edges of the useful display  you will note that the lines curve outward slightly in the middle and inward at the top and bottom  like i said  unless you have a sharp eye and are looking for it you may never notice it  i use my camera for business and often have to take pictures of telecommunication equipment racks  which are pretty straight  this camera eats power  the battery takes some time to charge and has little to show for it when it is charged  a second battery might be needed to get the most flexibility out of the camera  i find that i try to use the lcd screen only to view photos  and not to take them  this greatly adds to battery life the serial interface should be a last resort  unless you like long waits  this really has nothing to do with fuji or the camera  it really comes down to the speed of the serial bus in today s computers  i would suggest an aftermarket smartmedia reader  either floppy or usb based  i personal own a scandisk usb smartmedia reader  which allows instant access to my photos  without killing the camera battery in the process  last but not least  don t drop it  no kidding  right  after all it is a camera  the die cast shell might give you the false sense of durability  but believe me the inside of this camera is packed tightly  drops or hard shocks will damage it easily other then that this camera is a dream  i would recommend it to anyone  at the same time i would recommend four other options external smartmedia reader   speeds things up and saves battery power extra smart media of 16 or 32 meg   the 8 meg smart card is just too small and will only allow for about 14 16 hi res  pictures extra battery   because when the battery dies and you are away from home or the hotel  you are out of luck tripod   great for timed shots  or when you use the slow shutter setting  unless you can hold yourself robotic like still  ,love almost everything camera own mine one year complaints high praise let start say rate expectations camera relative mean would buy go

479,camera, great  one word  i used to have the mavica fd 73  until it was  quot misplaced quot  at a car show  i operate a very graphic intensive website that require frequent updates of pictures and images  every since losing my fd 73  i have been looking for a replacement  i wanted something with superb zoom  yet easy to use and transfer pictures to my computer  although this unit was much bigger than its competitors  the features more than made it up for it since most of my images end up on the web at 300x400  i wasn t too concerned with the megapixel rate nor the quality  my main goal was to have a camera that can zoom  i use it mainly at car shows and events where i can t get too close to the performers or entertainers  with this incredible 20x zoom  i m able to take quality pictures without having to dig my way through a crowd  i used to prefer to use my canon rebel 2000 over the fd 73 because my pictures turn out better when using a view finder  i didn t like to have to rely on the lcd screen to frame my shots  but the trouble with taking real pictures is the after process of developing  scanning  and resizing  one of the main selling points of the fd 95 is its view finder  which evidently has a  quot eye sensing quot  feature to avoid battery drain  the main reason sony mavicas are such hot sellers is because that they take floppy disks over smart media or cards  floppy disks are cheap  the fd 95 allows me to record in 640x480 and up to 1600x1200 resolution  so no matter what resolution i decide to use  i can always have a stash of floppies in my bag to store them in  at 640x480  i can get as many as 35 pictures on to one floppy  i elected to buy the 64mb memory stick with floppy adapter which could store 5 600 pictures at one time  i still carry at least 5 floppies with me in case someone with me wants a copy of the pictures i m taking  sharing pictures with  25 floppies are much cheaper than letting friends borrow your memory card  then worrying when they will return it the battery that comes with the fd 95 lasts about 2 230 images on average  this camera doesn t come with a charger  instead you get a cable that attached directly onto the camera  therefore  you can actually use the camera while it is charging  i ve also got the extended sony infolithium battery which allows for 3 350 pictures per charge  a good investment if you take a lot of pictures while traveling the camera also comes with a hot shoe  but unfortunately you have to use the sony external flash  i thought that any flash would work with it since the internal flash is often insufficient for taking pictures in poorly lit areas  such as car show buildings and night clubs  most people who see my camera complain about the size  yes  it is quite a large camera compared to most digitals available  i personally prefer larger cameras as they feel more comfortable in my hand  a big guy holding a tiny little camera looks funny to me  i ve always had the perception that big cameras make the photographer look professional  lol  if you can get past the size and a little bit slower in image recording time  then this is the camera for you  i take an average of 4 500 pictures per event i attend so i am used to carrying a bag anyway  now instead of rolls of film  i have a surplus of floppies and a batter or two     ,great one word use mavra ff quit misplace quit car show

481,camera, olympus 146 newly introduced cutting edge camedia c 5050 five megapixel digital camera takes the ongoing evolution of digital photography to a completely new plateau  olympus stretched digital imaging parameters by expanding the capabilities of the standard 1 1 8 148 ccd sensor to five million pixels  theoretically  making the pixels smaller  the only way to increase resolution without increasing ccd size  was expected to raise digital noise levels to an unacceptable level  olympus encouraged their engineers to think outside the box and strive for increased resolution from the standard sized ccd without increasing digital noise levels were they able to accomplish this goal  yes and no digital noise is present  as it is in all digitally generated images  but it is very well controlled  five megapixel images place huge demands on digital camera lenses  since the optics must sharply focus a much higher resolution image where even small distortions and aberrations are magnified many times  olympus wisely matched the proven f1 8 f2 6 35 105 zoom developed for the c3040 to their new five megapixel ccd  add a tilting lcd monitor  ala the canon g1 2 3 and the nikon coolpix 5000 and 5700  a tough magnesium alloy version of their standard  147c 148 series body  point and shoot ease of use  a full range of manual exposure options  and a wide array of creative applications and you 146ve got what may be the best prosumer digital camera ever introduced  throw in the ability to use three different image storage formats  xd picture card  smart media  and cf types i   ii and microdrives  and the creative possibilities are almost limitless the c 5050 can produce professional quality images  just set the camera to one of its manual exposure modes and compose carefully  while using the  147live 148 histogram display to adjust sharpening color saturation  and contrast  set the white balance for the prevailing lighting and save your images as an uncompressed raw file  if you need video clips  with audio  the c 5050 146s movie mode is limited only by the amount of memory available  if you want to maximize your creative options then you 146ll need to spend some quality time getting intimately familiar with the c 5050 146s operation  but if you just want to forget all that and be a snapshooter for an evening  or if you want your spouse to agree that you really really need a new five megapixel digital camera  then you can set the c 5050 to program and hand it over so they can shoot the kids birthday party without worrying about f stops and shutter speeds  but you may have some difficulty getting it back from them afterward   viewfinder lcd  the c 5050 features a real image optical viewfinder with a diopter correction for eyeglasses wearers  the high eyepoint optical viewfinder zooms with the lens the c 5050 has a bright 1 8  tilting lcd monitor that also provides detailed information on aperture  shutter speed  image quality  and camera exposure settings  the lcd screen also provides a  live  histogram display in any automatic exposure mode  program  aperture  and shutter priority  when enabled through the lcd menu  the histogram highlights over or underexposed areas of the image  allowing photographers to fine tune exposure for correct balance of highlights and shadows  shooters can also use the lcd screen to review saved images  and zoom in on displayed images  the  quick view  function lets you switch quickly from shooting modes to playback mode   top deck lcd  the c50 146s status lcd shows major camera settings like focus mode  flash mode  drive mode  white balance  iso  exposure compensation  and image quality without using the battery draining lcd monitor  top deck lcd status screens are a real boon to digital photographers because they allow the battery drain from the lcd screen to be rigidly controlled by using the optical viewfinder and top deck lcd status screen rather than relying full time on the lcd monitor for exposure and status information  the c 5050 provides a very useful monochrome status lcd  but the c 5050 146s top deck status lcd isn 146t illuminated  which seems a strange omission in such a well designed prosumer digital camera   exposure options  programmed auto  scene modes  sports  landscape  night scenes  and portrait  aperture priority  shutter priority

elements for improved sharpness and color fidelity  users can make manual adjustments in 1 3 ev steps  this lens  first seen on the olympus c3040  enhances the camera s low light capabilities with the fastest maximum lens aperture on any fixed lens digital camera  under most lighting conditions  indoors and out  the lens will produce sharp  well exposed  highly  color  saturated images with resolution equal or superior to any fixed lens digital camera currently available   macro  olympus 146  147c 148 series cameras have always had good macro modes and the c 5050 continues that tradition and adds a new super macro mode with a minimum focusing distance of 1 148inch b ergonomics   controls  the c 5050 146s magnesium body feels solid and professional in your hands and the new tilting lcd screen is great  especially used as a waist level or overhead finder  the control layout is logical and the c 5050 146s user interface is simple and intuitive  menus are straightforward and access is uncomplicated  everything is where it should be and the camera is very comfortable to handle and remarkably easy to use   power  the c 5050 uses standard aa type batteries  4 nimh batteries and a charger are included  i used the c 5050 for two days with a freshly charged set of batteries  more than 200 shots with heavy lcd screen and frequent flash use  and never triggered the low power warning  my friend used the camera for three days with fresh batteries and never triggered the low power warning  his shots included outdoor scenics  night shots  and macro color tests  five days of intense use  more than 400 shots  on two sets of olympus nimh 1700mah batteries  two cr v3 lithium disposables can also be used   flash  the c 5050 146s built in multi mode intelligent speedlight

and film cameras and photographic equipment  has been trying to test as many newly introduced digital cameras as possible  which has kept the two of us pretty busy for the last month  a few weeks ago we tested the new olympus c 4000  which has been selling like hotcakes  and ever since he 146s been trying to get olympus 146 new five megapixel offerings  the c 50 and the c 5050  he was finally able to get the c 50 a couple of weeks ago and he got a c 5050 just before thanksgiving  the friday night after thanksgiving my friend took the c 5050 down to jefferson square to watch the annual  147light up louisville 148 festivities  he wasn 146t alone  over 100 000 people turned out to see the more than 1 000 000 christmas lights turn louisville 146s city county administrative district into a holiday wonderland  jefferson street in front of the courthouse temporarily becomes santa claus lane  after seeing the crowds on the tv news i was glad i chose to miss the chaos  after everything was over my friend took one look at the grid locked traffic and walked down to the foot of fourth street and spent half an hour shooting the christmas light bedecked  147belle of louisville 148 before finding his car and making his way home the shots of jefferson square were ok but nothing to write home about  the ninety year old red  white  and blue sternwheeler covered with christmas lights was an entirely different story  the old steamboat really turned out great the c 5050 turned in completely professional looking long exposures with great colors and no noticeable noise  i was really impressed when i saw the images of the belle on saturday afternoon  after it got dark we took the camera for a ride through the highlands and cherokee triangle neighborhoods to shoot christmas light displays in a couple of louisville 146s oldest and most interesting neighborhoods  we then drove down to  147old louisville 148 to shoot some of the hundreds of old victorian mansions along second  third  and fourth streets  the christmas lights in the highlands and old louisville may lack some of the  147over the top 148 drama present in our suburban displays  but they really dress up the wonderful old victorian houses  we also spent some time shooting some of the characters that make bardstown road come alive after dark on saturday night  the c 5050 did an incredible job  the built in flash works very well  147in close 148 for environmental portraits of bundled up skateboarders and goth music fans  the images  traditional victorian mansions with christmas lights   147woodpushers 148  and multi pierced goths  were all very well exposed with accurate colors and no detectable noise  we got together again on sunday morning to try some outdoor daylight shots  the weather was much better sunny and blue skies with patchy white clouds  but very cold  mid 20 146s  we bundled up and drove across the river to the falls of the ohio state park  just over the ohio river in clarksville  indiana  the park is the only place where you can actually see the 380 million year old devonian fossil beds  the exposed remains of an ancient reef  the reef used to form a short drop falls that impeded navigation on the ohio river  it was necessary to pull boats out of the river above the falls and  147portage 148 them  and their cargoes  to a site below the falls where they could be put back in the water  the  147portage 148 made the area the perfect site for a town general george rogers clark built a fort on sand island to protect kentucky  then a county in virginia  and control river traffic  that primitive little fort eventually became the city of louisville  next year the falls of the ohio will be a focal point for the three year lewis and clark bicentennial  the expedition to explore the louisiana purchase commenced its journey to the pacific from the falls of the ohio river  captain lewis joined co captain clark  the younger brother of louisville 146s founder george rogers clark  here  most of the corps of discovery party that accompanied lewis and clark to the pacific were from louisville  kentucky and jeffersonville  indiana  neither of us had been to the falls since mid summer  we wandered around for a couple of hours taking photos with the c 5050  and freezing our butts off  photography at the falls is much easier in the summer when the area is filled with an explosion of green growing things  hundreds of birds  dogs  kids  hikers  and fishermen  picture opportunities are much harder to find in early winter  we did get some nice shots of the louisville skyline from the fossil beds and we got a couple of good images of the fossil beds with some neat oblique afternoon lighting  the falls of the ohio state park is located at exit 0 on interstate 65  north  the c 5050 did just as well in bright daylight as it had done in the dark  the af assist light works beautifully  long exposures are a snap  no pun intended  and shutter lag  shot to shot times  and write to card times  especially if you use an xd picture card  are very quick b image quality  the c 5050 146s image quality is exceptional  easily as good or better than any five megapixel digital camera currently available  skin tones and colors are the most accurate i have seen to date and that has a lot to do with olympus 146 excellent image interpolation  all digital cameras use interpolation to balance colors and contrast  olympus redesigned the c 5050 146s interpolation software to produce more accurate colors and better contrast  my friend and i printed two 8x10 inch enlargements  from full sized jpeg files  on an epson stylus photo epx785 and they were both excellent  even when inspected with a 4x mamiya loupe  we also printed up a couple of shots from the falls at 5x7 and both were very good with accurate well saturated colors  excellent contrast  and tack sharp resolution  very impressive performance for the cheapest five megapixel digital camera currently available b a few concerns  the c 5050 146s optical viewfinder is a little tight  small  and you have to squash your nose against the lcd to use it  olympus could have done a better job here  the c 5050 has a really aggressive sharpening function at the default setting images tend to be hard edged and a little over sharp experiment with the minus settings until you find the level that works best for you  minus sharpening will also lower noise levels at the iso 100 setting  there is barely visible barrel distortion at the wide angle end of the c 5050 146s zoom range but pincushion distortion at the telephoto end of the zoom appears to be very well controlled  chromatic aberration is visible at the maximum aperture in high contrast scenes but can be easily controlled by using the histogram display to adjust contrast levels  or shoot at f4   conclusion  olympus is offering the c 5050 at a lower price than competing five megapixel digital cameras and that will oblige the other major manufacturers to improve their existing technology and offer new models that provide improved performance and incorporate proven components rather than introducing new technology  competition always benefits consumers because new technology is very very expensive to develop and consumers must pay the research and development costs  in addition  new technology always comes with bugs and first generation of consumers must act as the final stage of research and development at their own expense  if your digital camera is more than one year old then there are many reasons for upgrading  there have been many significant improvements including higher resolution and newer cameras are much faster  lcd screens are sharper and brighter and not as jerky  colors are truer and white balance is much improved  digital camera prices are the lowest they ve ever been  the camedia c 5050 is targeted toward advanced amateur and casual pro users who want manual control and advanced features  images from the c5050 are as good or better than the images from any 5 megapixel digital camera i have used  and in the final analysis image quality really is  147job one 148  everything else is just icing on the cake  to put a bit more of an emphasis on that statement  the c 5050 represents a real advance in the digital imaging evolution with the fastest lens  f 1 8  of any currently available digital camera  very good low light performance  lots of user input  an almost infinite variety of image adjustment options  and lots of serious image enhancing features

482,camera, i bought it as my first digital camera and was satisfied totally the look was great  the lcd screen size is ample the only con is that the battery drains out too soon  so have a backup set of recharge able batteries as a first time buyer of a digital camera  i did not know anything about digital cameras  when i was looking for a digital camera  my brother suggested to buy a camera with pixels between 2 and 3 mega pixels  it seems that cameras with 1 3 mega pixels are the standard for the most of digital cameras in the market  however  the quality of a picture taken by a 1 3 mega pixel camera seems slightly less than a normal picture taken by a non digital camera  so how good is 2 1 mega pixels  the real quality of pixels can be tested when a picture is enlarged  i was just amazed to see how much a 2 1 mega pixel digital picture can be enlarged without losing its clearness  a 8 x10  blow up can be printed with great results when clicked at best resolution and quality  you need to try it  the camera also comes with a 8 mb memory card and 2 5x digital zoom  i bought a 64 mb card for cheap and this stores as many photos as 600 photos at 600x480 resolution and 125 photos at the max resolution of 2 1 mega pixel as is the case for other digital cameras  the data can be easily sent by e mail to a friend or can be printed by a high level color picture printer  the included software and the u s b  link up make uploading photos to your computer a breeze  the software makes a virtual drive for the camera and can use the windows explorer to download pictures  there is a good image editing and album software included the quality of the picture printed by those high quality printers is not different  or better  from a picture taken by a non digital camera  also  if a picture did not turn out as you intended  the picture can be erased immediately without getting printed  considering its price  less than  150  fine pix 2300 offers the best value for a digital camera with over 2 mega pixels  in summary  just beware of the lack of optical zoom and bad battery life  ,buy first digital camera satisfy totally look great lead screen size ample con battery drain soon back set charge able batteries first time buyer digital camera know anything digital camera look digital camera brother suggest buy camera pip meg pip seem camera meg pip standard digital camera market however quality picture take meg fix camera seem slightly less normal picture take non digital camera good meg pip real quality pip test picture enlarge amaze see much meg fix digital picture enlarge without lose clearness blow print great result click best resolution quality need try camera also come mb memory card digital room buy mb card cheap store many photo photo resolution photo max resolution meg fix case digital camera data easily send mail friend print high level color picture printer include software link make unload photo computer breeze software make virtual drive camera use windows explorer download picture good image edit album software include quality picture print high quality printers different better picture take non digital camera also picture turn intend picture erase immediately without get print consider price less fine six offer best value digital camera meg pip summary beware lack optical room bad battery life
483,auto, we bought a 2003 passat glx wagon to finally escape from the boredom of minivans  and be able to get 4wd and still carry a reasonable quantity of stuff for lifestyle and hobbies  after looking at the top of the line subarus  we chose the passat for two reasons  much tighter  solid construction  and  just as important  enough room for the toes of folks in the back seat  strangely  the subaru leaves just minimal space  ours is the glx  which comes with a lot of standard stuff  including some neat gadgets  like rain sensing wipers  and our only extras are the 4wd  1 750  and tiptronic transmission  1 075  extras  we re glad we have both  especially the tiptronic  which makes in traffic handling smoother and more fun in which to drive  but the rest of the standard glx items add plenty of luxury  even the  monsoon  radio cd tape stereo system  which has plenty of power and rich audio  and steering wheel controls  too  the glx has a 190hp six  and that gives it plenty of performance  it handles smoothly  and visibility is terrific  the car is very comfortable in front  even though i m 6 1  and rear space is pretty good for full size  adult passengers  although it s a little tight for legroom  recent passengers on a 100 mile trip have said it was fine  however  and heck  we ride in front anyhow  on the glx model  the rear cargo area comes with a  roller shade  cover  which we like  and the cargo deck is fitted with nice carpeting with strips to support heavy items  these look nice  but the carpet and strips combine to be a little slippery  and there s no standard cargo net for grocery bags  an inconvenience  we ve ordered a rubber pad for the area to provide better cargo security  more news follows on this  a minor inconvenience  there are lots of cubbies and storage  and vw does one thing  as does audi  that emphasizes their user friendly emphasis  they even provide a specially little hidey hole for the owner s manual  all together  this is a remarkable compact car that is virtually completely satisfactory  and  it had zero defects  perfect as it came  and still fine after over 1000 miles   the above was written in october  2002  when we had about 1000 miles on the car  now  april 2003  after 5 000  we have confirmed the quality of the vehicle  still nice and taught but fuel mileage is a real concern  we ve gotten  at best  a little over 20mpg when doing real highway driving  clearly not where it should be  sticker showed 19 city  26 highway  our dealer is following up with vw  more news follows  if you live in the northwest as we do  the 4wd makes it a good ski and mountain traveler  too  ,buy pass wagon finally escape boredom minivans able get still carry reasonable quantity stuff lifestyle hobbies look top line suburbs choose pass two reason much tighter solid construction important enough room toe folks back seat strangely sugar leave minimal space come lot standard stuff include neat badge like rain sense paper extra tiptronic transmission extra glad especially tiptronic make traffic handle smoother fun drive rest standard items add plenty luxury even mansion radio tape sterno system plenty power rich audit sneer wheel control six give plenty performance candle smoothly visibility terrific car comfortable front even though rear space pretty good full size adult passengers although little tight bedroom recent passengers mile trip say fine however neck ride front anyhow model rear cargo area come roller shade cover like cargo deck fit nice cart strip support heavy items look nice carpet strip combine little slippery standard cargo net grocer bag inconvenience order rubber pad area provide better cargo security news follow minor inconvenience lot rubbles storage one thing audit emphasize user friendly emphasis even provide specially little hide hole owner manual together remarkable compact car virtually completely satisfactory zero defect perfect come still fine miles write october miles car april confirm quality vehicle still nice teach fuel mileage real concern get best little pg real highway drive clearly stick show city highway dealer follow news follow live northwest make good ski mountain traveler
484,camera, i started looking for a digital camera early this summer  and after looking at several in the store and reading several epinions  i chose the canon powershot s10  highest rated on epinions  which i use for all of my shopping information on what and more importantly where to buy it was a great choice in the last 6 mos i have taken over 200 great pictures  which more than i took over the last 10 years before i had the canon powershot s10  this camera is lightweight  small and easy to use  it is even semi water resistant  a few weekends ago on a camping trip i fell into the river in the excitement of my boyfriend catching a huge fish  and the camera somehow survived being fully submerged into the water  it still works perfectly  and i even managed to salvage the pictures i had taken before the face plant the only piece of criticism i have for this camera is that the battery life is very short   always have a few charged backup batteries on hand when you take this camera out otherwise  it is a great investment and i concur with everyone else on epinions who has reccommended it as a great purchase  i bought mine on buy com for about  400  but i am sure you can get it cheaper now  epinions will show you where to get the best deal  ,start look digital camera early summer look several store read several opinions choose canon powershot highest rate opinions use shop information importantly buy great choice last take great picture take last years canon powershot camera lightweight small easy use even semi water resistant weekend ago camp trip fell river excitement boyfriend catch huge fish camera somehow survive fully submerge water still work perfectly even manage savage picture take face plant piece criticism camera battery life short always charge back batteries hand take camera otherwise great investment concur everyone else opinions recommend great purchase buy mine buy com sure get cheaper opinions show get best deal

487,camera, well pooey  someone has written almost exactly the review i would have  i absolutely love the 780c  i have not bought any of the extras like rechargeable batteries or an adapter card yet  a friend who sells digital cameras kind of scoffed at me wanting to purchase this camera until he saw the quality of a picture taken  i rarely even use the highest resolution and get some of the most detailed clear pictures much better than even my 35mm camera  i find it very easy to use  and once you get the hang of the photo program it is a cinch  occasionally i find that i need to go in and fix up a picture usually to make it a bit lighter i have poor lighting in my house  but the results when you do that are even good  only takes some of the sharpness out of the picture  i really would recommend someone buying this camera  my mom loves receiving pictures i have printed on photo paper in the snail mail and i love not having to pay for the developing only to get a few good shots  my husband loves that he can delete a photo that didn t come out right hehe br br  ,well power someone write almost exactly review would absolutely love buy extra like rechargeable batteries adapt card yet friend cells digital camera kind coffee want purchase camera saw quality picture take rarely even use highest resolution get detail clear picture much better even mm camera find easy use get hang photo program inch occasionally find need go fix picture usually make bite lighter poor light house result even good take sharpness picture really would recommend someone buy camera mon love receive picture print photo paper snail mail love pay develop get good shots husband love delete photo come right br
488,auto, the s2000  it s flashy and it s fast  but it s never really fit into any category  if you re looking for something fast and powerful  you look towards porsche and audi  if you want a family car  you head towards honda and volvo  i would have thought that honda s changes for the better would have formed the s2000 into a more economy type car  instead they have taken all the practability out of it  jazzed up it s look  and made it a lot more fun  i test drived the s2000 at my local dealer  although i never really considered purchasing  i was definitely impressed  it was light and fast  and it seemed as though the handling fit like a glove  i was making turns at 45 without a bit of hesitation  and you could really feel the strength that went through the honda  it does have a few problems though  and actually  honda has make it a bit awkward to drive  the console  this is a quite important piece of the car  as it tells you some information vital to driving a car  honda took it and turned it into a video game  they re seemed to be charts and graphs and features and whatever else they could think of to make it look goofy  it hurt your head just looking at it  i have heard that a lot of the more recent releases were equipped with standard consoles  and if you find one like that  it s gonna be a lot more easier on you than the one i test drove  now for the family man  this is a nice looking car  but merely a toy  there is no possible way you could use this for a family  as it has only two seats  duh  and basically no storage room  i mean none  the trunk is small  and i m really not even sure if it fits a spare tire  even the glove compartment has been shrunken down  as it now folds out vertically  although it looks like everything would fall out of it  it does work alright  yet  i d definitely rather have a standard glove compartment  just like the console  this is one of honda s other  fun little gizmos  gas mileage isn t that bad for a family car  but simply ranks up with other sports cars  the dealer said it could get 26 miles to the gallon  but i d really say it s more like 22  if you wanted a practical car  turn around right now  the game s up on the s2000  price  well  i m not really sure if it s good or bad  since i don t know if i m judging a sports car or an economy car  i ll just say that it costs about  33k  but the dealers are getting up for  29k  if you get it through to them that you know how much their paying  a lot of dealers will give you the car for 30k and change  for a sports car 33 thousand isn t bad  but it s no porsche  but the s2000 does have 240 horses  so i d say that for 30k  you re getting a pretty good deal   once again  you re buying a toy  this is the kind of decision you d really want to think over before plunking down the cash  at the rate they re going right now  in a year you should be able to get one used for 15 or 16k  then again  it would be used my conclusion is good for this car  if you want a snappy sports car with a fairly good price and mediocre gas mileage  you ve found your car  it looks good on the road for all you chick magnets and it comes in quite a variety of colors  there s a new blue color  but i still prefer the black  you ll be getting a much better value if you can work your dealer down to  30k  and if you buy one now remember that it ll probably have the  video game  console and the annoying glove compartment  you could surely get those things changed  but then you d be putting more money down  and once you re talking in the  40k range  the s2000 s simply overpriced  look over the options before you buy and test drive  if you test drive it first  you might just simply fall in love this is my first review  so leave me a comment  if you have any questions about the review  the car  or anything in general  feel free to contact me at pavshow aol com  thank you for reading my first review  as i m going to need encouragement to think it s

490,auto, the chrysler corp  seems to be struggling a bit  it s not for a lack of good products  certainly dodge trucks have etched themselves on our collective consciousness as tough and durable alternatives to chevy or ford  and the dodge viper consistently makes the top ten where performance is concerned  the jeep liberty is a ten fold improvement over the cherokee it replaces  but what about the sedans   names like sebring  stratus  intrepid  and concorde don t seem to ring any bells with many consumers  again  not for a lack of good products   those cars are all fine choices  but seem to suffer from an anonymity of sorts a perfect case in point is the chrysler 300m  typically  chryslers have been more about luxury than performance  the 300m seeks to blend the two in keeping with the heritage of chrysler s  letter cars  of the 50s and 60s  granted  the number 300 used to be an indication of horsepower  but times change  chrysler s latest 300  the 300m  is an attractive and well balanced performance sedan similar in execution to an acura or infinity  the problem with chrysler is that no acura or infinity customers seem to be cross shopping the 300m with the i35 or tl  there s no good reason for this  other than the fact that the name  chrysler  lacks the name recognition or panache of an acura  infinity  or even lexus  lets face it  when a consumer hears the name  acura  they are not confused with thoughts of minivans or mid priced convertibles  the name acura means a few  specific things   luxury combined with performance and reliability  chrysler should do the same  give all the minivans and mid priced sedans and convertibles to dodge  and let chrysler stand as a premium brand that balances performance and luxury global product strategy aside  the 300m is quite a capable car  it does  in fact  blend performance and luxury  and does it very well  inside the 300m are nice  little touches of class such as the white faced gauges with chrome rings around them  an analog clock with the same chrome treatment  and a beautiful wood an leather steering wheel  although the steering wheel has many cruise control buttons  they do not light up at night  forcing the driver to take his her eyes off the road for just a second  the instrument cluster glows in a backlit neon bluish tint that feels both modern and retro at the same time  the luxury side of this car is obvious  leather seats are soft  but the leather lacks the quality feel of a cadillac  lexus or even a toyota  two person memory sets not only the seats  but mirrors  and radio stations as well  including the steering wheel in the memory settings would be even better  rear seat leg room is excellent  rivaling even the much larger cadillac deville  head room is also excellent  climate control buttons are simple  straightforward and easy to reach  audio controls are a little more confusing and seem to lack the ergonomic thoughtfulness found on many japanese cars  but an in dash cd changer is a welcome feature on any car  overall the dash is well laid out  and conveys a simple elegance  the main detractor inside the 300m is the overuse of cheap looking and feeling plastic  while much of the interior has a quality feel  much of the dash and console area seem cheap by comparison  on the road  the 300m lives up to its performance heritage with firm suspension and plenty of power  sure  a 300m should have 300 hp  but 250 is plenty  the 300m is powered by a 3 5 liter v6  and while 250 hp is  in fact plenty  this car lacks the all out grunt of the much more expensive cadillac seville sts  still  acceleration is brisk  and the engine has a pleasing growl even under hard stomps on the gas  the chrysler s v6 also has a sporty exhaust note  something that is noticeably lacking on other sport luxury sedans such as the deville dts  lexus gs  and infinity i35  hard cornering is nothing short of fun in the 300m  and while it s easy to make horsepower comparisons to cadillacs costing  10 20 000 more  the 300m will out handle most any sedan with the possible exception of an audi or bmw  comparing an audi to a chrysler  surely the grumbling has begun  but the 300m isn t just an appearance package  it s really a stiff and sporty car  when pressed hard  the nose has a tendency to push in the corners  but such is the nature of front wheel drive cars  remember  this is a car that can make spirited driving a blast  but still carry 5 adults comfortably  there is a slight price to pay for the 300m s agile cornering ability  on rough roads  the 300m s ride seems a bit harsh  lacking the softness of an acura or lexus  however both acura and lexus sedans are prone to much more body roll than the 300  continuing the sport theme is chrysler s autostick  auto manual transmission  this shift it yourself automatic is one of more responsive systems of any car that is so equipped  with the possible exception of porsche  once the autostick mode has been selected  the shifting is precise and quick  the shift lever itself has a quality feel  with virtually no excess  play  right to left  the only drawback to the autostick is the clunkiness with which it slides into the autostick gate  there is a bit of a catch when going back and forth between full automatic and autostick that is slightly unnerving  to enter autostick mode  the driver must shift into one extra notch below the  d  for drive  then move the lever right or left to move up or down a gear  in other auto manual equipped cars such as the kia optima  the shift it yourself mode is entered by sliding the shifter to the right  then moving the lever up or down to select a higher or lower gear  the type of system used in the kia is much more intuitive   this is a minor point at best  and most drivers will quickly adapt to the chrysler system with no complaint overall the 300m is an under appreciated sport sedan that is worth considering when shopping for other sporty sedans  bmw owners will likely not be swayed  but anyone considering a lexus  jaguar  acura or infinity owes it to themselves to test drive a 300m  the handling prowess will bring a smile to your face   it is an incredibly tight car  even though the interior is not up to lexus standards in terms of quality and comfort  it does have an elegance that is lacking in other american cars   even the deville s interior seems bland by comparison  the 300m s few shortcomings can be boiled down to just three  1  too much road noise 2  some cheap interior pieces 3  no lights on the steering wheel mounted controls  all told  the 300m is a good looking  roomy  somewhat affordable  sport sedan that offers a lot of sport with a little luxury  base price for the 300m is around  29 000  that does not include such extras as a sunroof or chrome wheels  the standard 300m is all you need to fulfill the sporting urge  but still retain the practicality of an everyday car  ,chrysler corps seem struggle bite lack good products certainly

491,camera, i m what some would call a professional artist  i ve worked as a photographer as well as a graphic artist  because of this  i like to think that i have a pretty good knowledge of what looks good  and i must tell you that you can get some great pics out of this little guy i say little in a figurative sense  this camera is a tad on the big heavy side  i m used to full sized working with 35mm slr cameras  tlr 120 cameras and even 4x5 large format cameras  so i m not too picky when it comes to lugging a camera around  the kodak dc240 is not cumbersome in any way  it is simply a little larger than i would have hoped  there are smaller digital cameras on the market  but they don t yield the same image quality and features  so a slightly larger size is an acceptable tradeoff  for me next  we come to the image size  resolution  offered  i ve found that for the majority of my uses  the kodak has actually given me more than i end up using  on the average  600x450 is about the size i use when sending pictures to family and friends  so 1280x960 is more than adequate  it allows me to do something that you can t really do when limited to 640x480   crop and scale  with some room to breathe   the optical zoom comes in handy quite frequently  and i find the option of 2 different light metering modes  center weighted and  multi pattern  to be quite generous  white balance and exposure compensation round out the suite of  photo  options  kodak goes beyond this and includes in camera effects  which can be quite fun  as well as user definable borders  this is especially useful when you are connecting the camera through the included video adapter cable  i was extremely impressed with the quality of the video output from this little camera  it can be useful for reviewing the contents of the memory card when a camera is not available  i really liked the driver software included with the camera  it allows your camera to be seen through windows98 explorer  as if it were a hard drive or zip disk  just no drive letter  and enables you to simply drag and drop the picture you want off of your camera  i found the usb connection speed to be just a little too slow  though it s dramatically faster than some others i ve seen  now for the little things that i m not totally happy with the camera offers decent battery life when the lcd and flash are not being used  though it can run through the batteries before you even fill up your memory card with both enabled  i ve noticed that the pictures come out a little too saturated at times  and a little too bright at others  so a little tweaking with the photoshop ish program of your choice may be in order to get the best results  in general though  the images don t need to be retouched  it s just a matter of personal preference  kodak doesn t seem to have included a method to reset the picture count  the pictures are named in sequence  to my knowledge  and i would really like to see some facility for that  the only serious flaw i ve found in this camera is occasional lockups in the camera itself  i haven t found any mention of this on the kodak website  and i haven t seen any firmware updates to address the problem either  regardless  the problem is very infrequent  all in all i d recommend the camera to anyone looking to get into digital photography or just looking for something with a quicker cheaper turnaround than a 1hour photolab  this camera is perfect for families and small business offices  but nothing beyond that  film is still the best way to go for real graphics work  and i doubt that digital will be able to completely displace it for quite a while br br  ,would call professional artist work photographer well graphics artist like think pretty good knowledge

492,auto, i bought a used 1995 dodge intrepid in 1996  i paid  12 500  i compared the intrepid to the ford taurus  and learned that the intrepid has more interior space  for less money  that summer 5 adults took a 2 week road trip in the intrepid  we spent a good deal of our trip in the rocky mountains of colorado   rocky mt  national park actually  the car ran flawlessly at high altitude  the intrepid does well in city traffic such as denver  the 5 of us were able to still talk to each other at the end of our road trip  all of us commented how the intrepid made our lengthy road trip fun  and comfortable  i spent some time as a passenger  and i can say i enjoyed the huge backseat  we have the smaller engine  and in montana s  quot autobahn quot  i 90  we had no trouble keeping up with all the other 90 mph traffic  the only little mechanical glinch we ve experienced is the odd cigarette lighter that somehow blows fuses that operate the horn  nobody in our family smokes  or uses the lighter  the wiring is just a bit off  we got rid of the lighter  amp  the problem  we consistently get mileage in the 25 mph range  the car has plenty of space  power  and  quot creature comforts quot  it has over 75k miles now  i change the oil at 3000 miles  there is a tiny bit of road noise at speed  but for the money  the car is a good touring rig  we plan to keep this car for some time     ,buy use dodge intrepid pay compare intrepid ford turn learn intrepid interior space less money summer adults take week road trip intrepid spend good deal trip rocky mountains colorado rocky mt national park actually car run fearlessly high attitude intrepid well city traffic denver us able still talk end road trip us comment intrepid make lengthy road trip fun comfortable spend time passenger say enjoy huge backseat smaller engine montana quit autobahn quit trouble keep may traffic little mechanical clinch experience odd cigarette lighter somehow blow fuse operate horn nobody family smoke use lighter wire bite get rid lighter amp problem consistently get mileage may range car plenty space power quit creature comfort quit miles change oil miles tiny bite road noise speed money car good pour fig plan keep car time
493,auto, let me say it from the outset  i love volvo station wagons  this is my third volvo wagon  but my first new car ever  of any sort my husband bob and i bought our 2000 v70 in august 2000  we didn t intend to buy a car just then  we d attended a volvo station wagon test drive event in mid july  and became acquainted with the new volvos and what they have to offer  we loved the test drive but thought we were years away from buying another car  so we ate swedish meatballs  enjoyed the various performances  and used our free tickets to the liberty science center from volvo  the science center parking lot was the location of the event less than a month later  our mechanic declared our 1984 bmw not worth repairing  our other car  which was our  quot newer quot  car  is a 1987 volvo 240 wagon that we bought used in 1995  we narrowed our choices to three  1  buy bob s father s 1990 honda civic  2 search out another used volvo wagon  3 buy a new minivan  preferably a toyota sienna or honda odyssey  dutifully  we did some online research  searched the classified ads and poked around on local dealers  lots  resigned that our best option was another used wagon  we headed to red bank volvo at red bank volvo we found several perfectly nice used wagons  we also looked enviously at the 2001 wagons that had just arrived  what we didn t count on was our discovery of five 2000 v70s for sale  the cars had been used as service loaners  in an effort to snag the attention of people who already owned volvos and would possibly be in the market for another in the future  these wagons were loaded with nice options  all had sunroofs  leather interiors and winter packages  each had 3000 5000 miles on the odometer and came with a new car warranty this added a wrinkle to our decision making  here was a car that was all we ever dared dream of in a station wagon  and at  29 000  it was several thousand dollars less than a 2001 would be  on the other hand  if we were willing to spend that much  why not just go for the gusto and get a 2001  in fact  we thought  why not really go for it and take european delivery  then we d get the car and a nice trip for about the price of a 2001 we came back to our senses and decided that the best deal for us was one of the 2000 v70 loaners  there were two green ones  two blue ones and a black one available on our first visit  by the time we went back a day or two later to choose a car  both green and the black one were still available  but one of the blue ones had been sold  we took another good look at the remaining four and chose the blue one the car has been nothing short of thrilling for me  it is so  of course  in the quiet  elegant way a volvo would be thrilling  the car handles easily  smoothly and well  pick up is good  and the car s interior is virtually soundproofed from outside noise and engine sounds  this is our first car with a cd player and we are enjoying it a lot  the audio quality is excellent  our car has an automatic sunroof that we use almost daily  either fully open  or as a moonroof  the car is equipped with an optional winter package  but luckily it hasn t been cold enough in nj yet for us to have used it the car s steering is responsive but firm  i like the way the brakes handle  it makes me feel as in control of a car as i ever have been  the dashboard controls and indicators are clearly marked and easy to use  our car has an optional feature knob called  quot info quot  near the trip odometer  the knob can be adjusted to display various pieces of information  such as outdoor temperature  actual miles per gallon  average miles per gallon for the trip  or the number of miles until refueling is necessary  seating in the car is considerably more roomy than our 240 wagon  there is more driver leg room  and the car has an overall feeling of being wider than the 240  the back seat comfortably seats two adults and a child  it might even be ok for three adults to sit across for a trip that isn t too long  the back seat also features a built in booster seat that our seven year old and her friends fight to sit in  which is not usually the case with a booster seat and children their age  the driver s seat features three memory settings so that all i have to do is push the number 1 setting on the seat base and the seat bottom and back will automatically move to the position i have chosen we have had the optional third seat installed  at an additional cost of about  1 200  this seat can hold two children weighing up to 80 pounds each  the addition of this seat means that we can have up to seven people in the car  2 adults in the front  three children in the back and two children in the third seat  knowing that we could add this seating capacity eased our anxiety about foregoing the carrying capacity of a minivan     ,let say outset love vulvo station wagons third vulvo wagon first new car ever sort husband bob buy august intend buy car attend

494,auto, i had just started a new job  i m in sales  and i need a car that would be reliable and something i could feel good about owning  my first new car was a 1994 chevy cavalier  which i never regretted buying because of both it s appearance and performance  i wanted to do the same with this car  my wife s family swears by honda and i have always been impressed when i see older hondas that still look sharp and not outdated  honda also has a good reputation for durability  we originally were looking at honda civic to fit in with my newlywed  new job budget  however  they were trying to unload the 2002 accords to get the 2003 s in  read  excuse to tell you that you are getting a good price on the car  so we went with the accord  the reason that we chose the special edition was because my wife really liked the model  it is a sharp looking car  we got the black coupe  without the  flap   spoiler  i am proud to own it from that standpoint  and we did get a good deal  the special edition gives you  aluminum rims  am fm cassette cd stereo w  6 speakers  adjustable seats raise and lower  moon roof and cruise control performance has given me mixed feelings  i do drive the car alot  14 000 miles in 6 months  it doesn t have alot of power  take off speed is often slow  especially if the car hasn t had a chance to warm up  going up hills is a big concern for me because i live in a hilly town  i got stuck on my first hill here in the winter  i started from a dead stop on an upgrade and barely made it up  i never had any problems like that before  i never thought i was getting a race car  but i expected a little more than that the windows fog at every given opportunity as well  what is even more strange is using the air conditioner over the heater gets rid of it quicker  the stereo is top notch  i was ready to replace it right off the bat  but it can be loud if you need it loud and the sound is good with the six speaker system another good feature is the inability to lock your keys in the car  if the keys are in the ignition  and you hit lock on the car either by manually pressing the lock stick down or the all lock button  and you shut the door  it will automatically unlock overall the car is nice  but i think i paid too much for it  even at 18 000  the real test will be after i have hit 100 000 miles and what the car looks like then  ,start new job sales need car would reliable something could feel good own first new car cavalier never regret buy appearance performance want car wife family swear hand always impress see older hand still look sharp outdated hand also good reputation disability originally look hand civic fit newlywed new job budget however try unload accord get read excuse tell get good price car go accord reason choose special edition wife really like model sharp look car get black couple without flap spoil proud standpoint get good deal special edition give aluminium aim cassette sterno speakers adjustable seat raise lower moon roof cruise control performance give mix feel drive car clot miles months clot power take speed often slow especially car chance warm go hill big concern live hilly town get stick first hill winter start dead stop upgrade barely make never problems like never think get race car expect little windows fog every give opportunity well even strange use air condition theater get rid quicker sterno top notch ready replace right bat loud need loud sound good six speaker system another good feature inability lock key car key munition hit lock car either mentally press lock stick lock button shut door automatically clock overall car nice think pay much even real test hit miles car look like
495,auto, i ve now had my 2002 aerio for 15 000 miles  and can bring to you a review with some experience behind it the pros the aerio is definitely inexpensive compared with other similar cars out there  standard  the aerio has cruise control  air conditioning  power windows  power mirror adjustment  in dash cd player  foglamps and a trunk organizer that is just fabulous  i looked at several other similarly priced featured models  and found them to be underfeatured or overpriced compared to the aerio every time  i was particularly shocked with the ford focus wagon  which i felt was a terrible value  it rattled and creaked while driving  was underpowered and poorly designed and ford had few incentives to buy  on the other hand  the mazda protege 5 is a wonderful car with good features  but comprably equipped it is much more expensive than the aerio  i believe the aerio is a great value the aerio has a lot of room and is a very easy car to live with  the seats are comfortable in front and back  and my basketball playing  6 7ft tall  friends have commended it on the ample backseat leg and headroom  the rear seats both fold down for transporting stuff  and can be adjusted back in three positions  from nearly erect to a slightly reclined position  for the comfort of your passengers  the rear seats have a fold down armrest with a cup holder  which my passengers like  for storage  the aerio has a large glove compartment  a drawer under the front passenger seat  shallow door pockets in front  three cupholders in the console  two in front  one in back  magazine pockets on the back of the front seats  a pocket in the very back  and one of my favorite features  a multi compartment storage area under the rear deck that includes an integrated bucket  you know all that stuff that seems to build up in your trunk  you can store it in here  making for a neater car and keeping it handy at the same time  with the seats folded down for stowing  i have been surprised at what will fit in back  i have fit a 32  tv  in box  a full size whirlpool clothes dryer  not to mention several tables and other stuff  short of an suv or pickup  the aerio has a lot of space for the price the aerio is an economical car to drive  powered by a 141 hp  2 0 liter  inline 4  the aerio gets about 26 mpg in the city and 33 mpg on the highway  i ve found that it s important to keep an eye on the aerio s tire pressure or these numbers plummet fast  the aerio comes backed with an excellent warranty as well  and the success of the car ensures plentiful parts for years to come  the aerio is fun to drive  i d describe the engine as  peppy  in that i  leadfoot  rarely feel like my need for speed is being denied  when needing extra juice for a high speed merge or pass  a tromp on the gas is all it takes and the aerio takes off with aplomb  when the a c is running  the pep is a little more restrained  but not too much  ride is better than i would expect from a car this economical  but it s not perfect  there is road  tire and engine noise present at all speeds  but not to the point that it is bothersome  in my opinion  if you are looking for a dead quiet ride  i recommend mercedes  d  the handling is not sports car quality  either  but predictable and reliably solid  the turning radius is quite tight  making for easy quick parking  u turns and other maneuvers  seat comfort is good  i ve driven it 10 hours nonstop without causing much soreness or bother  the dashboard of the aerio might take a little getting used to  but it makes sense  the digital readout is a little strange but is completely functional and well designed  the heating ac switches are easy to understand  as is the stereo  windshield wiper and cruise controls  the a c  when running full blast  is cold  i strongly suspect an 8 year old could drive the aerio  it s that simple  the neutrals much has been said about the aerio s look  some say it s ugly  some say it s wierd  i say it looks just fine for me the cons as mentioned above  the aerio is not the most insular of rides  bad roads will be felt and heard while driving  just as good roads make for a very pleasant ride  suzuki makes a  100 center console armrest for the aerio  i believe this should come included as it would increase driving comfort significantly a pet peeve of mine is that the a c always runs when the front defog defroster is on  while this makes it work very well  i would have preferred to have the choice of running the defog defrost and a c together rather than having them linked  the rear tray that covers the luggage area is a little flimsy  i no longer use it at all  but this is because when i did  it became clear that taking it out and replacing it often would probably lead to its breaking in the near future when i be jammin  to loud music  the door speakers can sometimes vibrate  causing a buzzing noise  otherwise  the stereo is great  and i ve discovered that the buzzing stops if one cracks each window a centimeter or so the mesh used on the seats and doors seems to hold soil more than other fabrics  but  all in all  after my first 15 000 miles  i can make the following conclusions    i love my aerio   i drive my aerio whenever i can  my wife hardly drives anymore    the aerio is an excellent value    the aerio is versatile   great for moving stuff  road trips  and passengers    the aerio is fun  ,period miles bring review experience behind pro period definitely expensive compare similar cars standard period cruise control air condition power windows power

501,camera, are you one of those people who purchased a webcam or a digital camera five years ago and considered yourself a leader  have you upgraded that purchase since then  if not  you might be surprised to find what is out there and the functions that have been added to make the webcam experience and the digital camera experience more fun my fiance has long pushed me to purchase an  inexpensive  digital camera  one that we could on vacations or to the shore and not worry about it every second of the trip  yet one that still took decent photos  sure  you can try the throw away digital cameras  but the photo quality is still lacking  hence  the smile on my face when i came upon the logitech clicksmart 420  solid digital camera that will not break the bank the specifics  up to 1 3 megapixel pictures  8 megabytes internal flash memory  storage for over 80 pictures and 70 seconds of video  video capture resolution of 320 x 240 as a digital camera  video capture resolution of 640 x 480 pixels as a webcam  built in microphone and tripod options  picture formats include jpeg and avi  four aaa batteries  one touch flash  delete  and timer functions  wrist strap and lens cover there are other specifics that are more important to the serious photographer  but i did not list them  the reason is that this is a not a digital camera for the serious photographer  the 420 is a solid digital camera that is probably not going to be the best camera that you own what i like 1  ease of use  the 420 is almost all one touch  you can delete pictures with one touch and set the flash and timer functions with just a touch  you can also take a photo and send an email with just a single touch  heck  downloading the software is just a few steps more than a single touch  anyone can learn and use this in a short period of time 2  the price quality debate  like i mentioned  this is not a great camera  but for the price i would argue that it is pretty good  the photos and options are not going to be as good as what you get with your  1 000 00 digital camera  but they will be fairly good  from time to time i will find that i get a photo that is not of great quality  so what  with a digital camera you simply delete it and try again  considering that you are paying less than  100 for the 420  i think you will agree that the quality is pretty good 3  the ability to send photos over the internet  this has always been one of the more annoying aspects of the digital camera for me  i purchased my parents a  800 digital camera last christmas and we still struggle with the picture sharing function  the 420 makes things fairly easy  you have the usb cable and the docking station and then the software  then you simply take a photo or video as you would normally and save it  finally  you put the camera in the docking station and select the picture or video you want to email and click the send button  that is it and the beauty of it is that it works  you can also send to a mac or a pc 4  the durability  ok  this is the reason we bought the 420  the 420 has rounded edges that make a drop less painful and a rubber and plastic casing that make the drop harmless  the pieces are put together well enough that you can drop the camera on the beach and not suffer from sand ruining things  now let me back up a second and mention that we have not tried these things  but you can feel the tautness of the design and the durability that the rubber provides  5  we are not there yet  but a great camera for kids  first of all  the durability mentioned above makes the 420 a nice camera for kids  secondly  the rounded edges mean less likelyhood of a nasty fall  thirdly  the large buttons provide for ease of use  finally  the one touch operation makes the 420 easy to learn  hence  the 420 is truly a good camera for a child 6  the dual function of webcam digital camera  i do not use the webcam function all that often  but when i do i like a webcam that i can depend on  oftentimes this will depend on what service you are using  aol  msn  yahoo  etc  but it also often depends on the webcam itself  the 420 works with all the major im platforms and provides video and audio options along with the standard chat  the webcam option provides a clear picture on both ends of the spectrum  a big change  no longer are you stuck with a webcam that needs a bright light in order for the other person to see you  hallelujah and again the webcam function is very easy to use 7  the memory is pretty good  you can save 80 pictures without downloading and that is more than i will ever have on a camera at a single time  remember  if you do not like a photo you can delete it  finding 80 pictures that you like  from say a single trip  is a lot  the same goes for the 70 seconds of video  while this is not a lot of time  it is enough to capture a video of something unexpected or special that you otherwise would have missed  8  customer service  i am not sure that is the right term for what i mean  but it will have to work  logitech has always provided me with a good customer service option  the people people know what they are talking about and the wait is usually not too long  i also find that the two year product guarantee is a nice touch  i doubt i will need to use the customer service line or the guarantee  but it is nice to know that both are available and useful what i do not like 1  the batteries  the 420 runs on four aaa batteries  you can take a decent amount of pictures  but the video function is going to drain the battery quickly  aside from keeping the cost down  i am not sure why logitech did not go ahead and utilize a better battery  2  the memory is  pretty  good  aside from keeping the cost down  i am not sure why logitech did not provide the option of a memory stick or something similar in order to expand the available memory  i will never go over the 80 pictures that can be saved  but you may  in this day and age  logitech dropped the ball by not including this option with the 420 the bottom line we purchased the logitech clicksmart 420 as a second digital camera webcam and it has met our high expectations  we wanted something that we would not stress about while on vacation  we did not want to have to worry about it on the beach or fret over it falling out of the golf cart  we wanted a good camera that would do what we asked of it  take a decent picture  be trouble free  and easy to use  finally  we did not want to spend a lot of money since this was going to be a second camera for us i would highly recommend the 420 for someone looking for a solid second camera  a starter digital camera  or a camera for a child  the 420 is easy to use  durable  and priced reasonably  ,one people purchase webcam

502,camera, i didn t do too much homework in selecting this particular model at the time i was looking to upgrade from my 2 1 megapixel camera to a 3 megapixel camera without having to pay the current prices  so i spent my time lurking around the ubid website and won the bid on this particular model  for those who don t mind getting yesteryear s technology with the model being refurbished this is a great website to buy from i had a few brands in mind and lets just say this was one of them i felt comfortable in purchasing  in spite of all the purported shortcomings with this model they can be easily cured first  most people have complained about the short battery life and its somewhat proprietary battery  i ve solved this problem by buying a third party battery pack maha  that allows me to shoot with the monitor on for easily 5  hours and the battery was still strong  second  issues with the small compact flash card provided  well that is a standard practice and i ve been able to use quite a few offbrand cards in the camera simple technology  dan elec  i o data  with no problems  third  the problem with the on off switch being easily tripped  my suggestion is to reverse the battery and this will prevent inadvertent powerups now as to my observations on this model  yes  this model is very compact which is great for those who might be travelers or those with small to average hands  but those with large hands might have trouble overgripping this model  the room between the grip and lens is pretty small now the lens does protrude so it would be hard to misplace a finger over the lens but the other hand might inadvertently cover the flash or viewfinder  this model comes with the capability for automatic mode and manual settings  i must say that if you are the type that does not enjoy reading manuals to find out about details don t get this camera it has an overly engineered menu and for some functions you have to be pushing down on two controls simultaneously aperture  shutter speed  iso setting with regards to the point and shoot capability the camera has some appealing features  the shutter button can be depressed partially to lock in a focus setting when the focus is not in the center of the frame  for a little more trouble one can switch to some ten specialized settings while in  scene  for optimized camera function to capture  portrait  indoor party  sunset  firework  etc  now with regards to the more advanced settings i was a bit disappointed  first  the aperture setting only allows you to choose the outside ranges only  setting the shutter  aperture  and iso required manipulation of two controls simultaneously which isn t conducive for rapid shooting  if you don t mind spending a couple of hours poring over the features than you probably will not mind the complexity my overall impression of this camera is favorable for the following reasons  its a compact model and the body is entirely plastic which makes for a very lightweight model  this comes in handy when one has extension lens on the camera  there are multiple settings besides the point and shoot mode allowing one to customize the aperture  shutter and iso sensitivity  one feature for those who like to know exact setting for every shot will enjoy the playback feature which lists all the photographic settings for each shot and this information can be downloaded to a text file  besides the good selection of addon accessories for this model quite a few third party addons can be found  comparing this model to more updated models in the nikon line 885  i didn t feel like i was losing that much  the zoom range is 3x versus 2 5x  otherwise all the functionality seemed to be the same in both models  ,much homework select particular model time look upgrade megapixel camera megapixel camera without pay current price spend time lurk around bid webster bid particular model mind get yesteryear technology model refurbish great webster buy band mind let say one felt comfortable purchase spite support shortcomings model easily cure first people complain short battery life somewhat proprietary battery solve problem buy third party

503,camera, not me  that was my primary reason for purchasing this camera  i wanted to carry around something with me that took great pictures  didn t require film  and could fit in my pocket more or less luckily  a co worker purchased this same camera before me and let me test drive it for a weekend  i loved it  i took pictures using the medium size  1280x1024  and medium compression and when i received my prints from ofoto  i was in awe they were indistinguishable from film  i m not a trained pro or anything  but that doesn t matter to me  i just wanted great prints that i could send to my parents and friends i ve been to china four times in the past year  not to mention many miscellaneous excursions in the western u s  and have found the camera to be a great traveling companion  it s a great tool to preserve memories  while i love my s10  it s not without it s flaws first  i had to buy the battery and charger separately  they kit cost me about  75 if i remember correctly not very cheap  also  you are unable to get a 2nd battery separately you have to buy another charger  i haven t checked in a while on this though  second  the shutter is kinda slow there is very noticable delay from the time you press the button and the time the camera actually captures the image  this is resulted in countless blurred images from letting people who are not used to the delay take pictures for me  they end up snapping the picture and not realizing they had to wait an extra second for the camera to capture the image  start moving to return the camera to me when i check the camera  the image is blurred  using the small screen  you can t always tell the image is blurred either another downside  my third major complaint is the zoom and the horrible digital zoom  the zoom is only 2x and that really doesn t do much  i m used to a 250mm zoom on my old slr and this is nothing close  luckily  i haven t had much occasion to use the zoom so it hasn t been too bad living with the zoom  oh and the digital zoom is not usable at all it s slow and looks very bad  the minor complaint i have is durability  i m not one to really pamper my electronics especially trekking around china  but i ve tried to take fairly good care of my camera  the camera is still intact  the screen and body however are pretty scratched up  i don t really care about this as long as the camera works but some of you may after all the complaints  i ve come to realize that this is a fairly first generation product  but a damned good one  the negatives i pointed out above are far outweighed by the compactness and picture quality of the camera  i couldn t be happier with this camera well except if i could by an extra battery without another charger   ,primary reason purchase camera want carry around something take great picture require film could fit pocket less luckily co worker purchase camera let test drive weekend love take picture use medium size medium compression receive print foot awe indistinguishable film train pro anything matter want great print could send parent friends china four time past year mention many miscellaneous excursions western find camera great travel companion great tool preserve memories love without flaw first buy battery charge separately kit cost remember correctly cheap also unable get nd battery separately buy another charge check though second shutter kind slow noticeable delay time press button time camera actually capture image result countless blur image let people use delay take picture end snap picture realize wait extra second camera capture image start move return camera check camera image blur use small screen always tell image blur either another downside third major complaint room horrible digital room room really much use mm room old sir nothing close luckily much occasion use room bad live room oh digital room unable slow look bad minor complaint disability one really paper electronics especially break around china try take fairly good care camera camera still intact screen body however pretty scratch really care long camera work may complaints come realize fairly first generation product damn good one negative point far outweigh compactness picture quality camera happier camera well except could extra battery without another charge
504,camera, i just bought this camera a little over a week ago for a trip to disney   i already had a toshiba 2mp digital camera that i had been using for 2 years  but was not happy with the zoom and some other features  i consider myself a pretty serious picture taker  not an  expert  but i like photography  i am also somewhat of a technical buff i just got back from my trip and took more than 150 pictures   video clips  this camera was awesome  very intuitive and easy to use  the prints came out great too  definitely worth the money  i paid approx  360  including next day shipping  the 10x optical zoom is great  anyone who is a serious   knowledgeable picture taker knows that digital zoom means absolutely nothing   you can always zoom the picture with your pc software  i bought the camera based upon other reviews i previously read in epinions  the only advance concerns i had  based upon the other reviews  was a comment about the lens cap and another comment about the af noise while filming video clips  after using the camera for a week  i agree that the lens cap is a  little  inconvenient  but not really a problem  it could be better  but i didn t really mind  i did not experience the af noise with my video clips overall  this camera was great  i am very happy with it    battery life was great  definitely better than with my previous digital camera  i just rotated a fresh set each day to be safe  even though the indicator was at full strength  i used energizer 2100ma rechargeables  optical zoom was great   this was my main reason for buying this camera  video clips were great quality  easy to use  menus are very intuitive  focus in dark light was very good  even without a flash  easy to hook up to my pc and download pictures   the only issue i have here is that the software package provided could be a little better  my toshiba software package was better  other comments   suggestions    you will need to buy a couple more sd cards  the one provided is only 16 mb  typical  i bought 2 additional 128 mb cards  you will need to buy a bag  buy an extra set of batteries  typical can you tell that i like this camera  ,buy camera little week ago trip dinner already toshiba digital camera use years happy room feature consider pretty serious picture take expert like photography also somewhat technical buff get back trip take picture video clip camera awesome intuition easy use print come great definitely worth money pay approve include next day ship optical room great anyone serious knowledgeable picture take know digital room mean absolutely nothing always room picture pp software buy camera base upon review previously read opinions advance concern base upon review comment lens cap another comment noise fill video clip use camera week agree lens cap little inconvenient really problem could better really mind experience noise video clip overall camera great happy battery life great definitely better previous digital camera rotate fresh set day safe even though indicator full strength use energies rechargeables optical room great main reason buy camera video clip great quality easy use venus intuition focus dark light good even without flash easy hook pp download picture issue software package provide could little better toshiba software package better comment suggestions need buy couple sd card one provide mb typical buy additional mb card need buy bag buy extra set batteries typical tell like camera

506,camera, i bought this camera for my boyfriend and reluctantly used it during our vacation to europe  i was not disappointed  it took great  crisp pics and i was happily able to delete the pics i didn t want  the last time i went to europe  i was a college kid  and was going for 6 weeks  i figured i d need 50 rolls of film  which i bought  i took pictures of everything and used up about 48 rolls  spent hundreds of dollars on the film and developing  then on copies to give to friends family who wanted something  what a commitment  with the digital camera  you can email pics  print them up  send them out  make post cards  greeting cards  etc  without having to pay another dime to do so  so  you use up more ink in your printer  this is the true reason for color printers  to enhance our lives  i ve sent packets of wallet sized pics to friends and family so they can see what i did and where i was  the end of post cards  this trip marked the end of the post card for me  i spent about  1 25 for each card and stamp  i could have spent less than that by sending several small pics in a letter anyway   i love the ability to zoom in and out  to take movies  soundless  15 or 33 seconds at a time  to delete pics that you ve changed your mind about or in which your friend s eyes are closed  just take another two  three or four  and pick the one you like  delete the rest i don t like the fact that when you look through the view finder  you won t see the entire picture of what you re taking  your view is cut off a bit  so you re actually including in your picture a little bit more than you re looking at  the batteries died maybe 1 week after my trip started  thank goodness for the guy at j r who told me to get batteries  i brought rechargeable batteries and they worked well i used a sandisk smartmedia card and another one  can t remember the name  the second one gives me a  card error  when i was ready to upload the pics onto my desktop  not something i want to see after taking pictures of beautiful italy  after a few prayers and attempts  it worked  haven t touched it since  all in all  this was a great buy and a good investment  my friend s digital camera had a smaller screen  and it wasn t as clear  couldn t see certain details and it was slower  ,buy camera boyfriend reluctantly use vacation europe disappoint take great crisp pick happily able delete pick want last time go europe college kid go weeks figure need roll film buy take picture everything use roll spend hundreds dollars film develop copy give friends family want something commitment digital camera email pick print send make post card greet card etc without pay another time use ink printer true reason color printers enhance live send packets wallet size pick friends family see end post card trip mark end post card spend card stamp could spend less send several small pick letter anyway love ability room take move boundless second time delete pick change mind friend eye close take another two three four pick one like delete rest like fact look view finder see entire picture take view cut bite actually include picture little bite look batteries die maybe week trip start thank goodness guy tell get batteries bring rechargeable batteries work well use sand smartmedia card another one remember name second one give card error ready unload pick onto desktop something want see take picture beautiful italy prayers attempt work touch since great buy good investment friend digital camera smaller screen clear see certain detail slower
507,camera, i bought my mavica a little over 7 months ago  i quickly grew to really appreciate its great photo quality  and its overall ease of use and convenience  its a great camera which i rely on for many of my picture taking needs some of the things which i really enjoy about it are 1  excellent photo quality   currently  i am taking most of my pictures at 640x480 resolution  and the quality is set to fine  at this rate  i can put about 14 16 snapshots of above average quality on each disk  if i want to take a  quot nicer quot  picture  i just need to increase the resolution  i ve printed pictures from it as well as posted them online  and in both cases  i ve felt that the pictures were of excellent quality  i was even able to frame a couple of the ones that i printed 2  uses floppys to store pictures   floppys are excellent for storing pictures  instead of having to travel with multiple rolls of film  or having to buy several expensive media cards of some sort  i just carry around a box of 20 25 floppys which i can leave in the camera bag when i m taking pictures  it might not be the smallest setup you can carry around  but it is quite practical for most picture taking situations 3  easy to download pictures   the floppys make it easy for you to download photos to any computer you want to  you don t need to drag the camera over to one particular machine in order to use a cable  or use special software to download it  you just pop out the disk  and put it in a disk drive  the picture files are saved as jpgs so they can be viewed with almost any graphics program 4  very easy to use   this is a very simple camera to use  it does require that you spend some time learning to use it and getting familiar with its controls  but for the most part  that s normal for all good cameras  it has many many nice features which you don t need to use often  but most of its main controls are handled from on screen menus on the lcd screen  navigating the menus is easy  and when it comes down to it  taking the pictures just requires that you point and shoot  the only reason that i would say this camera is not intuitive to use  is that it has so many functions  it takes some time to familiarize yourself with were they are  if you get this camera  spend a weekend playing around with it and testing out all of its features  and you ll feel quite comfortable using it some things which i find somewhat annoying 1  slow to write data to disks   this is the most annoying problem with this camera  it takes between 5 15 seconds for it to record each picture on the disk  during this time  you can t do anything with the camera  in most situations  this is not a huge problem  but it can be frustrating  i have also noticed that it takes it longer to finish writing a picture if you have zoomed in on your subject  2  battery meter can be inaccurate   if you do extensive file viewing etc  the battery can wear out surprisingly fast  not only that  but the meter tends to not report accurately while you are viewing files  in general though  once you know this  you can be careful and the battery will last for quite a while 3  somewhat large bulky   this is not a small camera  it is a fair bit bigger than small point and shoot cameras and it is bigger than the body of most slrs  this is not a major drawback  but it can be somewhat annoying when you are packing for a trip  it is fairly light though  so its extra size does not really affect its overall usability 4  mpeg quality isn t great   the quality of its mpegs isn t really good  i ve tried different options  but it just doesn t produce output which i am satisfied with  this is almost certainly because this is primarily a camera for still photographs which also happens to record some video  it is possible to record the occasional ok mpeg  but i don t think that sony spent much effort on this particular feature  all things considered  i really do like this camera  it does have a few things which i find somewhat troublesome  but none of them are really that terrible  i only mention them so that people with specific camera needs aren t taken by surprise  for instance  this is not a great camera for recording high action sports type shots  its also not good as a video camera  if you are looking for a good  reliable  camera which is very flexible  and easy to work  then you should definitely consider this  its output is top notch  while it is not quite up to par with the best slr cameras out there  it easily handles 90  of the photography tasks which you might encounter and it gives you great results br br  ,buy mavra little months ago quickly grow really appreciate great photo quality overall ease use convenience great camera rely many picture take need things really enjoy

509,camera, i had been hinting at a digital camera for christmas but was surprised when my husband actually got one  after talking to several people  both sales people and those that had digital cameras  he chose the olympus d 490 zoom  it s been very easy to figure out with the help of the manual  the manual itself is easy to understand and it s not difficult to find something if i have a question  the camera can be used in two different ways  you can simply open the cover and point and shoot  or you can also open the lens cover and view your subjects through the monitor  much like looking through a cam corder screen  so far the pictures have been of good quality  though i haven t tried to print one out yet  because my main objective at this point is to email pictures to friends and family i can choose a lower resolution setting and get more pictures at a time  but if i chose to print it s very easy to change the settings to a higher resolution  i d like to have a few of the accessories but the camera works just fine without them  they would just make the download to my computer easier and faster  i have an older computer so it takes a couple of minutes to download but not so long that it gets frustrating  ,hint digital camera christmas surprise husband actually get one talk several people sales people digital camera choose polypus room easy figure help manual manual easy understand difficult find something question camera use two different ways simply open cover point shoot also open lens cover view subject monitor much like look order screen far picture good quality though try print one yet main objective point email picture friends family choose lower resolution set get picture time choose print easy change settings higher resolution like accessories camera work fine without would make download computer easier faster older computer take couple minutes download long get frustration
510,auto, i have found my inner child  and he s a thirteen year old boy  this is a tremendous discovery for someone s mother to make  if you ask me  but i think it s true  the whole thing started because my old mazda rx 7 needed work  a lot of work  i owned the car outright  but it had reached the age where it was going to take thousands of dollars a couple of times a year to keep it driving anything like i wanted  despite argument from my significant other  my emotional attachment to the rx 7   my first ever fun car   was such that i really did plan to just keep fixing it again and again  or else replace it with a newer rx 7 if i could find one  well  just as i was about to finally bite the bullet and get major transmission work done on the rx 7  my main squeeze threw me and our two year old son in his van  and took me out to a car lot where  side by side  sat a used corvette and a newer rx 7 turbo  i test drove the rx 7  and found it similar to the one i already had  only with absolutely zero cargo space  i planned to test drive the vette  but they d locked the keys in the car  inspired  though  i headed to the chevy dealership to see if they had any used vettes  and they did   but not in my price range  to my surprise  though  the showroom floor camaro ss was available at a price i could talk myself into  giggling a little inside  i took a camaro ss for a test drive  i was surprised by how much i liked it  tons of zip  enough cargo space to pick up a reasonable load of groceries if i needed to  comfortable seats that were even big enough for my son s car seat  if only i liked the way it looked  i thanked the chevy dealer for the test drive  and headed up the street to the pontiac dealer  where i found a bargain  a low miles  bright red 1995 trans am  six speed with the hurst shifters  half the price of the new camaro ss  so i took that one for a ride too first of all  i have bad knees  so a few years ago  i came to grips with the notion that i wouldn t be driving stick anymore  it had been years  but it came right back driving that fun car  a little slow stop and start around surface streets  then out onto the highway and next thing i know  there i am in 6th  severely over the speed limit at 1500 rpm  i took the car out of gear  got off the freeway  and went back to the dealership  angel on one shoulder saying  quot but remember  you can t drive stick anymore  remember your knees shaking in traffic quot  and devil on the other saying   quot who cares  who cares  this car rules quot  this  like i say  is where the teenage boy comes in i looked at every trans am on that lot  unlike the camaros  they didn t have any automatics in stock  i worked that dealer  had him showing me every little feature of every trans am  and then i got back in the aged rx 7 and  responsibly  drove home without buying a stick but back at the house  i started my trans am research in earnest  i was intrigued to compare firebirds and camaros  learning that more camaros are made than firebirds  that a larger percentage of women buy firebirds than camaros  while the opposite is true of camaros  i walked around for a few days saying things like  quot hey  it s a version of the corvette engine quot  and  quot i think traction control would be a major plus quot  and  quot okay  can you explain the difference between gear ratio and axle ratio quot just like that  i d managed to tell myself i could sever my emotional bond with my rx 7  and i knew that i wanted to replace it with a hefty american v8  for a new  sporty car  that meant i had 3 options  firebird  camaro  or mustang  for a slightly used car  a corvette frankly  i just don t like the looks of the new mustang at all  and to get the same horsepower that are standard with a camaro or firebird  i would have had to spring for a mustang svt cobra  with a higher sticker price than i wanted to pay for a car whose looks i don t like  and which i constantly see lots of on the road anyway  what s more  i fail to see why the absolute top of the line mustang  the svt cobra r  actually gets any play when you could buy a new corvette for the same price  people actually pick a mustang over a vette  ford must have some advertising whizzes  but naaaah  the mustang was never a contender for me the used corvette was  however  after a fair amount of contemplation  i decided that what i really wanted to do was buy my first brand new car  where i got to pick out the colour and everything  and it came with a solid warranty and no miles on it and it would be mine from the very beginning  so  back to camaro vs  firebird  first of all  the base v6 was right out  i m sure it s a great car  but after driving the 305 horsepower v8s  i had to have one  i didn t even bother to test drive the 200 horsepower v6 firebird or camaro  if i d been in the market for a v6  however  either the camaro or the firebird would have been a hands down win over the v6 mustang  which i ve rented and  frankly  enjoyed less than a camry   which is too bad  because i wanted to like the mustang  deciding between the camaro and firebird ended up being easier than one might think  while i liked the way the camaro handled  and its features and options  and while the price was right and there were plenty of camaro sses around that were automatic transmission  the bottom line is i liked the looks of the trans am better  it took me the better part of a week to find an automatic trans am to test drive  to be sure i liked the way the automatic transmission felt  deep down  the teenage boy inside me kept hollering the whole time   quot you don t care  so what about your knees  get this one  get it  get it  yeah  don t drive the dying rx 7 off this lot quot when i finally found one  it was an automatic trans am with the ws6 performance package on it  and it was a 2001  which meant i wouldn t be able to take advantage of the  1500 rebate for the 2000 model year  and the bottom line there was that the car was just a little more expensive than i really wanted to pay  for features that i wasn t likely to ever really capitalize on   17 quot  wheels  15 more horses  and the functional scoops with tougher looking hood  for example i ended up picking out an automatic trans am to be delivered from about a hundred miles away  with the only options being chromed wheels  traction control  and the  quot performance axle quot  with the 3 23 ratio  while the waiting for the car to be delivered was sheer torture  i could not be happier with the vehicle first of all  i m thrilled with its pure oomph  i m learning to drive all over again   if i drive this car the way i drove the rx 7  i m going to get arrested  step anything but lightly on the accelerator when the light turns green  and the tires will squeal  this car is very quick off the line   the same kind of driving that would keep me reasonably in step with other cars before now leaves me seeing them far back in the rear view mirror  of course  this means i ve got to be vigilant if i m not the first one up at the light   pickup is exceptional  even at highway speeds  this means the car really is terrific in california freeway traffic  if i need to be somewhere else  fast  it s no problem  it s great to have the power to accelerate out of potentially sticky situations even when the overall flow of traffic is already exceeding the speed limit  i m also very happy with braking  since i don t have downshifting for an added measure of control  in an automatic  and the car s overall responsiveness  take a week of silicon valley driving  and you re guaranteed a few chances to find out how your car reacts to adverse traffic scenarios  while i ve heard complaints about visibility  i have to say it s superior to what i had in the rx 7  yes  the rear window is short  so you don t get a tall view of the road there  and that takes some getting used to  as does seeing the rear spoiler in the reflection  however  the side mirrors are excellent  and the glance over the shoulder blind spot is much smaller than the one i had with the rx 7  which was enough of a blind spot to hide an entire geo metro  ask me how i learned that one  i didn t get the driver s seat with lumbar support  just the basic 6 way power seat  if i were expecting to do nonstop roadtrips  or if i already had back problems  i would likely have opted for the upgraded seat  but i m perfectly happy with this one  and suspect i would be even for the occasional roadtrip  however  i expect a passenger would want to make more frequent stops to stretch his legs  given the lump in the floor which i understand hides the catalytic converter  and no one but a child could make a roadtrip in this vehicle as a back seat passenger speaking of children  my son s toddler car seat fits quite nicely in the back  and there are tether strap anchor points for two car seats  while i think his view was better from the passenger seat of the two seater rx 7  in the trans am he can watch all the mirrors and has the view out the tinted glass t tops  although he does tend to kick the passenger seat some  he s got enough room to be comfortable  and his major problem appears to be when we stop   he will start screaming   quot go  go  go  car quot  i also find that it s nice to be able to reach easily to hand him things and so forth  without having to tell him to keep his hand off the shifter and not kick the stereo  like in a 2 seater  and of course  i love it that now all three people in our family can go for a ride in the fun car at once  the stereo is great  i did not opt for the 12 cd changer  figuring that if i do someday decide i want one  i can probably find one that will work with the car s head unit for under  600  the price of the factory installed changer  i m definitely going to get spoiled by the radio controls on the steering wheel  too i m thrilled with the t tops as an open air alternative to a convertible  lots more openness than even a huge power moonroof gave me on the rx 7  and little enough wind turbulence that  even though i have three feet of hair  i am comfortable and hair doesn t get blown in my face  restricting my vision  an equally long haired passenger reported the same thing  i ve been advised  about the t tops  to unlatch them in the event that the car ever needs to be jacked up  so as to avoid any potential torque being applied to that part of the car  which could result in a leaky t top  by the same token  the manual says never to take the car through a car wash that sprays high pressure water in the area of the t tops  so it looks like this will be a wash by hand car forever  what s more  the manual says the chromed wheels are prone to damage by brushes in a car wash  so i guess i ll be washing it and making periodic visits to the upscale car detailers  though classified as a sub compact  this is a bigger car than you would think  it s nearly as long as my main squeeze s extended gmc safari  and weighing in at 3500 pounds  almost as much as a coupe deville and more than a chevy s 10 pickup   this car weighs as much as some suvs  so you can t drive it like you would a lightweight vehicle  nor does this vehicle get subcompact gas mileage  for silicon valley traffic driving  admittedly with the air conditioning on  i seem to be getting about 17 miles to the gallon the list of standard features on a trans am is truly exceptional  especially for the price  no  it doesn t have the full complement of luxury sedan features  but one wouldn t expect it to  but the list of standard equipment is long enough that it barely fits in the section for it on the car s window sticker  overall  i would wholeheartedly recommend this car to anyone who wants a fun  fast car  with a few caveats  you won t be able to fit a huge amount of cargo in it  though it s got adequate space  you won t be able to carry around a gaggle of your friends  and it will be anything but cheap to fill it with the premium gas the manual sternly recommends  additionally  i would not recommend this car to an inexperienced driver  the steep rake angle of the hood makes it hard to get a feel for where the car ends  and similarly  it s hard to know this moving in reverse  further  with the major amount of oomph right at all speeds i ve driven so far  and a top speed that s supposed to be 160

512,auto, i bought a 2001 corolla le in august 2000 and have put on about 50 000 miles  i originally owned an  83 tercel that taught me the virtues of a long lasting simple automobile  i drove cross country six times in the  yoter  and only had to change a fuel pump and some warped rotors along the way   but those happened well after the car had 100 000 miles ok  back to the corolla  after living in baltimore for a couple of years  the exterior has an interesting assortment of dings  dents  and scratches  but the interior is pure gold  no problems with any mechanical or electrical system  everything works just like the day i bought it fuel economy is excellent  and i m the type of person who calculates it religiously   i have a 5 speed and i usually average 38 39 mpg with mostly highway driving  if i do more in town driving  that might drop to about 36 mpg  performance is fair to middling   acceleration is slow in first gear  second is better  and third has some muscle  the clutch is not too forgiving and takes some practice  and the hair trigger accelerator doesn t help matters much  i ve done some severe weather driving and the car is sure footed in snow and rain   front wheel drive and the manual transmission do the trick  braking is ok but requires more force on the pedal than one might be used to  especially in an emergency situation  handling is fairly tight but the car s cheap suspension and 14 inch wheels show up on bumpy terrain  despite occasional discomfort the suspension appears to be hardy  having dealt with baltimore s awful streets without any repairs to date  and a high speed impact with a rock on the highway didn t cause any damage beyond a tire let s talk about size for a moment  i m 6 foot 5 inches tall  and i m at my limit in terms of interior space  and forget it for the person in the back seat behind me  but the weird thing is i ve sat in a lot of so called bigger cars and they re all worse  even the new cadillacs  one notable exception is the volkswagen golf  which has a great front seat and lots of legroom  the corolla has pretty generous head room but the leg room is tight  i recommend cruise control so at least you can move around a little on longer trips interior ergonomics are efficient and to the point  controls and displays are easy to use and designed to last  the cruise control has a great feature where you can push the lever up to go 1 mph faster or down to go 1 mph slower  i also like the automatic headlights   you never have to worry about turning them on or off good design extends to the engine compartment  all the fluids are very easy to check and refill if necessary  the air filter and lightbulbs are easy to change too  the engine itself is all aluminum and you don t see the usual copious amount of plastic  there s a generous space between the bumper and the engine  which would save lots of dough in a front end crash in this age of monster suvs  the issue is going to be  is it too small  but let me point out the benefits   tight turning circle  getting into those parking spots nobody else can  and the ability to weave through city traffic  the corolla has a big trunk  no problem packing up for a two week vacation  and on smooth roads you can pretend you re in a much bigger car  another advantage of small is affordability   i paid 15 grand including taxes and tags  a pretty good deal considering how long i expect the car to last based on my past experience with the tercel  200 000 miles is a reasonable lifetime for the corolla  and the repairs i expect to make are new brakes  300  and tires  350  around 75k miles  and again at 150k  and possibly a new alternator  300  starter  300  struts  300  and waterpump  300  around 100 150k miles  ok  maybe the fuel pump  200  at some point too  the exhaust systems and ac last forever on the corolla  according to consumer reports surveys  the key is that these items are easy to identify when they break and don t rack up the bill for labor by the way  these prices assume that you never  never take your car to the dealer  which is the ultimate no no if you want to save money on car repairs  with the corolla  you can gleefully ignore the recommended servicing  just have your local mechanic check things when you go in for an oil change  look for that gas station repair shop with a guy named chip  mike  steve  or joe  that ll be your place the corolla is a car for people that want to  or have to  drive in an urban suburban environment without worrying about things breaking  and save lots of money along the way  this is the car that will take a licking and keep on ticking  but it s still a big step up from my old no ac  am radio yoter  which i affectionately called  the lawnmower with wheels  ,buy coolly le

513,camera, i was looking for a replacement for my nikon 950 a long time ago and wanted to try something else  the canon s20 was the smallest 3 3mpel camera i could find  and did not look as  clunky  as the nikon coolpix 990 there were a few signs of trouble from the beginning  1  i find the flash was even weaker than the old nikon950 which was itself not bright enough  taking pictures indoors or at night is not worth the effort if your room light is low  pictures always comes out bad 2  it takes non std batteries that don t last as long  the old nikon950 took aa s so i could get 1500mah nimh rechargeables cheaply and they last long enough for me to fill a 128mb cf outdoors if i switched off the monitor  this one requires a  100 rechargeable battery that will not even fill half of a 128mb cf  this means you really need two of them for a proper session  ie  we are talking  200 extra for batteries here instead of  25 for aa nimh and charger 3  when viewed on a screen  the extra pixels did not make the pictures any better than my old nikon coolpix 950  in fact  when i took similar material in bright sunlight   i saw that the pictures look either too blue or too red  but the color was definitely off here if i didn t already own a nikon coolpix 950  i would have thought this was a great camera  but i did  so this is not a good one to buy  spend a little more and get a better camera i was disappointed with this camera  and will probably get another brand when i upgrade  perhaps a higher res nikon  ,look replacement union long time ago want try something else canon smallest impel camera could find look cling union coolpix sign trouble begin find flash even weaker old union bright enough take picture indoors night worth effort room light low picture always come bad take non st batteries last long old union take could get may nigh rechargeables cheaply last long enough fill mb cf outdoor switch monitor one require rechargeable battery even fill half mb cf mean really need two proper session talk extra batteries instead nigh charge view screen extra pip make picture better old union coolpix fact take similar material bright sunlight saw picture look either blue red color definitely already union coolpix would think great camera good one buy spend little get better camera disappoint camera probably get another brand upgrade perhaps higher yes union

515,camera, as the heir apparent to the c 2500l from olympus  i expected great things from the c 2100uz  my expectations were  perhaps  a little too high the c 2100 features a 10x optical zoom  this is far better than most other consumer and prosumer cameras  digital or not  it uses smartmedia for storage and ships with an 8mb card  a lens cover and shoulder strap are included  four aa nimh batteries and a charger are included as well  olympus  camedia 2 0 and adobe photodeluxe are provided on cd for windows and mac  usb is the only connection available between the camera and a computer  therfore only usb equipped machines running windows 98  windows 2000 or mac os 9 will work with the camera  olympus makes a point of noting that even usb equipped machines that have been upgraded to windows 98 from windows 95 will not work with the camera  an a v cable is supplied for connecting to televisions and vcrs the maximum resolution of the camera is 1600x1200 or 2 1 megapixels  this is less than other current leading edge cameras feature  the camera can save in tiff or jpeg and can also capture short  30 sec  quicktime movie clips with sound at 15 frames per second  a continuous drive mode can capture about seven super high quality shots in about four seconds time  that does not include the time it takes to save the images to the memory card  an infra red remote is included for timed shots the c 2100uz is styled as an slr camera  cameras in this category are identified by their ability to accurately frame pictures by using through the lens  ttl  view finders  while this makes a big difference on traditional film cameras  it is not as big a selling point on digital cameras which use lcd displays that by their very nature display ttl images that can be used for framing a shot  of the few slr digital cameras available  the benfefit to the ttl viewfinder is that the image is purely optical  that is  you can see all the detail that a lcd screen cannot display  the c 2100 breaks this tradition by using a miniature lcd in the viewfinder instead of optics  this gives the camera a video camera type of feel  the benefit of this setup is the massive amount of setting information that can be displayed while framing a picture  including the effects of exposure compensation  the drawback is the lack of fine detail that true optics provide  back to the benefits  playback can be done on the viewfinder s lcd which uses far less power than the large rear mounted lcd  a button switches the display between the mini lcd and the large lcd at any time during capture or playback the camera s imaging sensor  ccd  supports iso equivalent sensitivities of 100  200 and 400  in point and shoot mode  the camera can select between these settings automatically  expect a tendency to use a higher film speed when set to auto mode  as with all digital cameras  there is a significant amount of image noise captured when higher speeds are used the manual controls for shutter speed  aperture and manual focus are very flexible  more flexible than even the c 2500l s controls  the manual focus control could have been made a little easier to use  although its feature of enlarging the image to show more detail while adjusting is handy  shutter priority and aperture priority modes are available in addition to a full manual mode  a handful of special modes are available under a special setting mode  this mode includes pre determined settings for night shots  portraits  and landscapes speaking of controls  most controls are easy to use  remember though   it is not a point and shoot camera so expect to take some time to learn all the settings to get full use out of the camera operation of the camera was not speedy  but it wasn t a dog either  playbacks were fairly fast  when capturing  cycle time between single shots was about three seconds  power on to first shot was four to five seconds without flash  continuous drive shots were about two to three frames per second without flash  expect delays when taking multiple shots while the camera saves to the slow smartmedia memory card by the way  what s up with olympus only supplying an 8mb card  it can only hold about sixteen shots  the c 2100 s predecessor   the c 2500l   shipped with a 32mb card  get a bigger card if your going to use this camera i was disappointed that the resolution of the camera was only 2 1 megapixels  with the industry trend to create high resolution pictures for better prints  this is a step backwards  the amazing 10x zoom almost makes up for this  quot flaw quot  for those looking to get closer to the action  you can t find much better than the zoom capabilities of this camera  coupled with a 2 7x continuous digital zoom  total  27x zoom  you won t find a solution in this price range that can beat the c 2100 for me  however  superior prints are more desirable than high zoom levels actual picture quality was good  but i did notice poor color accuracy in low light situations when a flash was not used  when a flash is used  careful control needs to be used so that your subject is not washed out  image sharpness was good  the built in focus assist light allowed the camera to focus in low light with little difficulty  of course  images captured at higher iso settings were fraught with pixel noise  images captured at iso 100 were as clean as can be expected overall  i would recommend this camera to those needing exceptional zoom capabilities who are not looking to print the images at large sizes there are better alternatives for those looking

516,camera, i have doubted many other digital cameras in the past but this camera i have to say can get the job done  i have used it at parties  for ebay and yahoo auctions  so far i can say the pictures come out clean and crisp  the flash works well in complete darkness too  i would have favored a larger smartmedia card because the 4mb they give you just isn t enough when you re on the run  and the batteries died out on me quick  i tried w o out using the lcd screen  but the viewfinder is just too small overall i would recommend this camera to any person looking for something decent and just to say they have a digital camera that works  but for high end applications you might want to look for the new sony mvc     ,doubt many digital camera past camera say get job do use party bay yakov auction far say picture come clean crisp flash work well complete darkness would favor larger smartmedia card mb give enough run batteries die quick try use lead screen viewfinder small overall would recommend camera person look something decent say digital camera work high end applications might want look new sonya mac

520,camera, having owned the dsc p1  i traded in my p1 for a dsc p7  although the megapixel count was the same  it was a big step up for several reasons thinness the camera is thinner than the p1 and definitely fits into a pants or shirt pocket very easily  on my 80 s style tight jeans  i often forget that the camera is even in my back pocket lcd screen the lcd is viewable in sunlight conditions  however  the screen does protrude significantly from the rest of the back of the camera  tarnishing the overall slimness of the camera  it s a bit irritating given the overall svelteness and sleekness of the camera  even with that the camera is very pocketable taking pictures the shutter lag is now on par with most digicams  about 0 5 seconds  picture quality is good movie editing the really neat feature is that you can cut slice movies to remove unwanted segments  this happens in edit mode  and is really handy for freeing up memory space when you re away from a pc quick movie turnaround movies are streamed directly to memory  once you finish taking a movie  you can immediately shoot your next movie  this is a great feature compared with other cameras that require a waiting period to write to memory before shooting the next movie movie length movies are limited in duration only by the size of the memory stick  which for a 128mb stick is about 6 minutes in high quality 320x240  23 minutes in 320x240  and 90 minutes in 160x120 still image shooting not much to say here  except that it shoots like most 3 2mp point n shoots  it doesn t have any direct manual controls over shutter speed or aperture  and it lacks shutter  aperture priority modes  so it isn t a primary camera for pros  but it does make a great point n shoot camera  backup camera  or take anywhere anytime camera  ,own duc trade duc although megapixel count big step several reason thinness camera thinner definitely fit part shirt pocket easily style tight jeans often forget camera even back pocket lead screen lead viable sunlight condition however screen protrude significantly rest back camera vanish overall slowness camera bite irritate give overall svelteness sleepless camera even camera pocketable take picture shutter law par digicams second picture quality good movie edit really neat feature cut slice move remove unwanted segment happen edit mode really handy free memory space away pp quick movie turnaround move stream directly memory finish take movie immediately shoot next movie great feature compare camera require wait period write memory shoot next movie length move limit duration size memory stick mb stick minutes high quality minutes minutes still image shoot much say except shoot like point shoot direct manual control shutter speed aperture lack shutter aperture priority modes primary camera pro make great point shoot camera back camera take anywhere daytime camera

523,camera,  note  update  150 5 2 03 i have updated the original  hope this review will be useful in helping you all  i have added more information such as lens flare  graininess etc  p s  i am  still  on the original bundled alkaline batteries so wow  5 stars for energy efficiency  now i have taken about a hundred high quality shots and about 20 minutes of video and frequent use of lcd for reviewing etc  flash use is moderate b first  a little rant on choosing either a70 or a60 b the powershot a60 is almost identical to the 3 mega pixel a70  physically  the only difference is a gray handgrip on the a70 while the a60 s is blue  functional differences are  640x480 movie mode for the a70  slightly faster multiple pictures shooting  about 2 6 fps vs  2 2 fps  and of course  the increase in mega pixels  so  if you do not need the extra pixels for printing 8x10 or larger pictures  the a60 will give you almost the same features as the a70  both cameras support direct print to compatible printers such as canon cp 10 and s800d   note  the a60 146s max resolution is actually adequate to produce decent 8 x 10 prints as i 146ve tried it myself you might think that since it 146s only  100 more  why not get the a70 anyway for the higher pixels  well  because if you are never going to print such large pictures  which uses a lot of ink and is expensive to print with ink jet printers  or a vga movie mode which really needs a huge compact flash card  then  you are really paying for pixels you 146ll never use  so why not use the  100 to buy an extra set of rechargeable batteries and a fast travel charger  that 146s better investment  a digicam is unlike a computer  more pixels doesn t mean future proofing  unlike pcs  where more megahertz or cpu clock speed means better future proofing  you only need as much pixels depending on the sizes of photos you ll need to print with good details   buying accessories 133   if you bought the a60  you could probably get a 128mb compactflash card  a mini usb cf card reader  and a soft case with the money saved from not getting the a70  or  you could opt for a 64mb card and a set of nimh batteries and charger  or you could use the money saved to get a set of photo ink cartridges and photo paper for your printer  of course  if you have the money to spare  then go ahead with the a70  the a60 shoots up to 1600 x 1200 and the a70 up to 2048 x 1536 pixels  i normally shoot at 1600 x 1200 which is sufficient to produce great 5 x 7 photos  and decent 8 x 10 as i 146ve experienced  this lower resolution  compared to the a70 146s max res  also allows me to take more pictures with the bundled 16 megabyte card  the camera is very comfortable to hold with a large handgrip  also part of the battery compartment  it 146s a bit tubby though and weighs around 300 grams with batteries  this means it 146s comfortable and steady in your hands but will not fit smaller pockets as easily as a sony u20  nor as portable   in the box 133   the camera comes with a 16 megabyte compact flash card  a wrist strap  software and camera manuals  two software cds  4 aa alkaline batteries  usb and video out cables  no soft case is included but i got one for free  the 16 megabyte card is too small by today 146s standards  you can only take about 16 pictures at the highest quality setting  the camera is recognized automatically by windows xp but on older systems  you will need to install the software drivers  now i 146ll get straight to what you probably want to know  how does it perform   performance   ever since getting this camera  i have taken about 3 dozen photos of various subjects ranging from kids to pets and close ups of plants and animals  i wish i can post these pictures here so you can see for yourself that this canon takes excellent quality photos  of course  you can also visit the many websites out there that feature reviews and sample pictures taken with the a60 or a70  judge for yourself but i am extremely satisfied with the quality myself  details are excellent  especially in close ups and portraits  indoor pictures with flash come out excellent as well  this is taken with the auto mode on  there are 12 shooting modes all in all  colors such as skin tones are spot on as well  startup time is about 3 seconds before you can begin shooting  shutter lag is hardly there in bright daylight or fast shutter speeds but becomes more apparent when shooting in dark indoors or at night  still  very fast response in my use my previous digicam was a first generation 0 8 mega pixel fuji and the pictures taken were too warm  i 146m really surprised at how far digicams have come today to producing the best and most accurate colors even in tricky indoor lighting conditions  i have printed out only three photos on my home canon bubble jet printer  4 x 6  and the results quite good  with my old fuji  i often had to correct and adjust the pictures before printing but with this camera  little adjustment and color correction is needed   picture softness b i have also sent off my cf card for processing at a digital color lab  fujifilm digital imaging  and the results  although a bit soft as testified by many other a70 a60 owners  look very pleasing with very good colors and decent detail level  the softness can easily be corrected through software sharpening before being printed out and even if sharpening is not done  it 146s still not that big of a deal  especially considering how many other positives the camera has going for it  i also notice that sharper digicam pictures also look grainier most times  the pictures on the a60 may not be super sharp but there is very little grain  especially at either iso 50 or iso 100  i heard the same is true for the s45 but have not seen pictures from the newer g3  i have handled the older g2 and it 146s just too bulky and heavy for my purposes but pictures are gorgeous as for  lens flare  i noticed a bit of it when shooting with the bright sun in the background or directly at it  there is also a bit of flare when shooting oncoming traffic  from headlights  at night  it isn 146t very bad compared with some other cameras i have used though  in fact  it performs better than with my samsung camera that 146s equipped with a sneichder kreuznach lens which is supposed to be specially coated to minimize lens flare b creative possibilities   one of the main reasons why i got this camera is because it offers so much creative control such as aperture priority  shutter priority  program ae and full manual control  in manual mode  you can change all exposure controls and settings  you can select shutter speeds of 15 seconds to 1 2000th of a second  aperture sizes of f2 8 to f8  different flash modes  auto focus  5 point or center focus  or manual focus  metering  center weighted  evaluative or spot  and many others  this is simply amazing and unbelievable at this price  there is even a custom white balance setting that you can set with either a white or gray card  there is no option to save your custom exposure settings though unlike the s45 which has one custom setting and the g3 which has two  no big loss  all other exposure settings remain the same after you set them as the information is stored in the camera and maintained by a small lithium battery  which also maintains date  for example if you choose shutter priority mode and set your shutter speed at 1 60  it will remain the same when you turn the camera off and then on to manual mode  there 146s also a focus assist light which is hardly found in budget digicams  very useful for shooting in the dark and also acts as the red eye reduction lamp a stitch assist mode lets you create splendid panorama shots by  147stitching 148 together multiple shots either horizontally or vertically or 360 degrees  the camera helps you align each shot by showing a bit of the previous shot on the lcd  very effective and stunning results b superb for newbies and enthusiasts alike   many who are new to digicams would probably be happy enough with the auto mode but if you are keen on learning more about photography techniques  this digicam  either a60 or a70  is the best budget choice  unlike a 35mm manual camera or slr  you don 146t have to be afraid of wasting film when experimenting with the various shooting modes and settings  i took photos of things around the house at various aperture settings and the results are great  i used a large aperture such as f2 8 to make the background blur out when taking a macro shot of a flower and a small aperture such as f8 to make everything including the background look sharp   at f8  a tripod is recommended as slow shutter speeds are sometimes needed especially when the day is cloudy or dark  if i didn 146t like any picture  i simply deleted it and started over again  no more wasted 35mm film and money wasted into developing a whole roll just to get one or two useable photos   good range of shutter speeds  another main reason why i got this camera is because of its wide range of shutter speeds  its slow speeds range up to 15 seconds  perfect for taking night scene shots  you can also choose  digital film  sensitivity from iso 50 to iso 400  anything slower than 1 3 seconds shutter speed will kick in the automatic noise reduction  for those of you who don 146t understand what this is  let me try to explain  when taking long exposure shots  noise  the stuff that makes your film look old and grainy  is almost always introduced into your pictures  this becomes much more severe at higher sensitivities such as iso 400  the camera employs an automatic noise reduction system to reduce this effect at slow shutter speeds  i took a 15 second night shot  no moon  just stars and some distant city lights  at iso 50 and the result was almost noise free  needless to say  i am much impressed   movie mode   movies are recorded with sound  in my opinion  movie modes on digicams are more like gimmicks than practical tools  they do however  provide a great way to capture small movie files for emailing to friends  especially after being edited and compressed with windows movie maker or other editing software  the camera records movies at 15 frames per second and the sound is monaural  i ve only used it twice to record small videos of the kids playing  a real amusement for the kiddies b battery life   i am still on the original bundled panasonic alkalines at the time of writing this  after taking dozens of high quality pictures with lcd on and average flash usage  i am extremely impressed by its energy efficiency  however  i recommend a set of rechargeable high capacity nimh batteries  personally  i use energizer 1700 mah batteries  overall  i have to say that battery life on this canon is simply excellent since i also used the lcd many times and for reviewing and making many manual mode settings and changes as well as connected it to my laptop for downloading b software   windows xp and mac os users will find that the camera is automatically configured for and useable without installing any of canon 146s bundled software  however  for more options and control  canon 146s zoom browser offers great versatility  i still prefer acdsee for cataloguing and browsing photo collections though  canon includes arcsoft 146s photo and video impressions software for making quick adjustments and editing of photos and videos  far from the best but adequate for newbies  i find photo impressions difficult and impractical to use with annoying button sound effects that can 146t be turned off  or i haven 146t found out how  adobe photoshop elements  a toned down version of photoshop  would have been an excellent bundled choice instead   the badside   i only have one major complaint and that is the flash does a terrible job throttling down for macro shots  macros are taken at distances as close as 5cm or 2 inches  macros at 5 cm with auto flash results in unuseable overexposed pictures  this is where the manual exposure control comes in real handy  for example  i experimented by taking a close up shot of the keys on a calculator at 5 cm  2 inches  range  on auto mode  the flash was fired and the picture was badly overexposed  so i switched to manual mode and set the shutter speed at 1 200 and aperture at f2 8 and voila  a perfect natural lighting shot  the calculator keys were perfectly exposed  all the letters were legible and clear and details extremely good  right down to the tiny scratches on the calculator surface  if you shoot at high resolutions  you can crop away certain parts of your macro shot to produce a great close up shot without loss of detail or pixilation  and as mentioned earlier  the camera 146s pictures are just a bit soft but this can be sharpened through software editing  and a small gripe  its cf card compartment cover is very flimsy  just waiting to break off  other than these  i have no other major complains   highly recommended   i highly recommend this camera  either model is good depending on your resolution needs  the camera is made in malaysia  not in japan  which probably helps to reduce its cost  it also has a plastic body  with only a metal front panel  it allows for further creativity by accepting add on macro and telephoto lenses and filters  there is also a waterproof casing available for it  no soft case is included in the box  so be sure to get one  i got one for free  the dealer threw one in for free when i complained that none was included  the case is specifically made for the a60 and a70 and is of a soft suede like material with good cushioning to protect the camera from small bumps and scratches   in conclusion 133  so what else can i say  i am very happy with my  280 purchase  you can get it for cheaper at some online stores so do shop around  it 146s a great camera and i have never enjoyed taking photos as much until now  the camera will keep both point and shooters and enthusiasts happy indeed  especially those on a budget  the softness in photos doesn 146t bother me much  it really isn 146t that bad  the photos are still very beautiful  but it might to some others  if this is the case  then you would have to move into the mid level canon s45 which does offer sharper pictures but cost a lot more  if you have lots of money to burn  and want a high quality small compact sized camera  look at the s45  nevertheless  i have no regrets getting this a60 model and buying a larger 128 mb cf card  rechargeable batteries and charger with the money saved these canon cameras come closer and closer to the prosumer  professional consumer  g2s and newer g3s  but are heavy and bulky  in terms of features  on a scale  i think the a60 and a70 are at the low budget end  while the s45 sits in the middle and the g3 at the top  the a60 and a70 cameras are a great move by canon  making many advanced manual controls available to the masses without unlimited cash  kudos to canon b this is how i would rate it b features  5 stars performance  4 stars ergonomics and build quality  4 stars battery life  5 stars value for money  5 stars this camera isn 146t perfect or doesn 146t have any flaws  but at this price  it has way more pros than cons so it rightfully earns its 5 star rating  ,note update update original

526,camera, i bought this camera at wal mart for  179 99 for our home personal use  as we were doing our  early   the week before christmas  i decided hide the wish list for a couple minutes and browse the electronics department  i ve been wanting a digital camera for several months now  if you re like me you have about twenty rolls of film still waiting to be developed  i researched all i could using the limited amount of information that they have beside the price tags  i picked up a few and held them as if i were to take a picture  after i picked up the ones that were completely out of my price range and then i stumbled upon the polaroid pdc 700  i was amazed how it felt in my hand  i looked through the viewfinder  it is smaller than i d like but hey  when you ve got a 1 8  lcd screen at your disposal who needs a viewfinder  there also is an lcd screen on top of the unit that tells you approximately how many exposures are left  what flash setting the camera is on  the battery life  and the mode of resolution selected  i noticed many features that i liked  it has 4mb of internal memory able to hold between 12 and 90 photos depending on what quality you desire  this camera will also stamp the time date on the photo  it does accept compactflash cards up 32mb  the buttons are small and identified by icons and abbreviations rather than clearly labeled english making it hard to get used to  it has two different lens settings for those up close shots  auto focus  and a built in flash with an adjustable auto white feature  the flash can be set to three different settings  auto  always on  or off  although it lacks red eye reduction we don t seem to get that much any how  it came with many things other cameras don t  the olympus camera i liked didn t come with the  30 ac adapter  it has a 10 second self timer  it is also tri pod mountable  the carrying case is perfect for this camera  i firmly holds this camera  it doesn t jar around like one you d have to buy if you bought a different model  the menu on the camera has many useful options  you can also use this camera for a webcam if you can capture the video from the lcd screen on the back  i did this by plugging the cameras included video cord into a vcr i have hooked up to my pc  the vcr is then connected to my pc via ati tv wonder card i bought for approximately  40  some video cards have this built on  this camera consumes batteries like crazy so we purchased some nimh batteries and a charger after blowing  9 00 worth of duracell ultra batteries in about a week  the picture quality is good if you want pictures to email and use primarily for your computer  i ve found that the shots i took outside are truely awesome  they look just like a 35mm 4x6 picture  but the pictures i took inside especially when i turned the flash off looked somewhat  grainy  although still bright  overall i would recommend this camera to people who want to spend less than  250 because you get so many extras  it comes with two different software programs although one is kind of  kiddyish  a usb cable  that really zips those photos on your pc  a serial cable  a video cable to connect to a television or vcr  ac adapter  4 aa duracell ultra batteries  good for about 50 60 shots if using the lcd as the primary viewfinder  a leather carrying case  a wrist strap  and a quick start guide  the driver supplied included twain compliant driver which allows you to download pictures of the camera using most other programs like mgi photosuite  etc  there isn t any real users manual  they are all in a file  and the website doesn t seem built for any support  for your own research  http www polaroid com products digital imaging digital cameras pdc700 index html we ve taken over 250 photos now  i feel we ve

528,auto, we bought our 2001 avalon xls in summer 2001 and love it  it s loaded with all the bells and whistles  option package  7  aka  the kitchen sink  sunroof  traction control  heated seats  etc  haven t yet located the button for the automatic back scratchers  i m sure i ll find it some day given that i m extremely happy with the car  i ll focus my comments on what s not so good the trip computer  w  computation of fuel economy  elapsed time  etc  is rendered virtually useless by the fact that it is automatically reset each time the ignition is switched off this is my biggest complaint with the car  and there is no control  that i know of  to change this setting our car was delivered out of alignment  the dealer rectified that at no charge  however  alignment has continued to be somewhat of an issue i have found that the car is very sensitive to front wheel tire inflation   i will admit  however  to being a bit obsessive  compulsive with regards to alignment and others many not be as particular as i audio controls on the steering wheel would be nice we have found the traction control to be great and combined with the anti lock brakes  the car handles very well in slushy weather the automatic headlights turn on a bit too late  i e  after it is a little too dark  the manual says that this can be adjusted by the dealer  but the guy i talked to at my service department didn t know anything about it  admittedly  however  he was no candidate for mensa the low fuel light on my avalon is useless  it never seemed to come on  leading me to suspect that it was broken  to test this  i decided to drive my car to as close to empty as possible  tempting fate in a stubborn test of wills with the tiny dashboard bulb   i usually fill up once i dip below a   tank  the low fuel warning light finally lit when the trip computer indicated we had only 14 miles to go until my wife had to get out and push us into the nearest gas station  the low fuel light had finally sent it 146s notice with less than half a gallon in the tank  this isn 146t a warning it 146s a lonely  final gasp of thirst if you 146re looking for a  147performance 148 sedan  the avalon isn 146t it  it 146s plenty fast and handles well  but the acura tl is sportier  but much more cramped  we looked at the maxima  but it seemed cheap and tacky  and the avalon  a sedate car in its on right  has the panache of a rolls royce compared to the coma inducing accord and camry  we thought about a volvo  but we didn 146t like the 5 cylinder engine and their quality ratings have plummeted in recent years  something to which my next door neighbor can attest as his new volvo s80 has been back to the dealer numerous times  a good friend recently bought a bmw 3 series  it 146s tiny compared to our avalon  isn 146t nearly as comfortable  and cost thousands more  granted  the beemer is faster and more of a performance car  but i think she got raked over the coals  maybe i 146m beyond my years  i 146m 35  but i 146m more interested in comfort than speed  the car ads on tv show beautiful people driving their cars on empty  winding roads at 80  mph  but i don 146t live in a car ad  i 146m not beautiful  the roads i drive are filled with yahoos  and if i was lucky enough to rev it up to 80 i d have a state trooper on me like a dog on a porkchop  given this context  i find the avalon to be a very comfortable and very capable performer we looked at american cars and without exception  we thought they were just absolute junk  other than selling a buick park avenue to my father in law every 12 years  i don 146t know how gm stays in business  the avalon has the perfect mix of quality  comfort  and performance that we were looking for  ,buy valor summer love load bell whistle option

531,auto,   different or an old trend    the  147honda element 148 is not what you would call a new design  it is different yes  there 146s no arguing that  but is it in fact a new design that honda came up as an original that they could call their own  well  not quite  if you thought thoroughly about the  147honda element 146s 148 structure you would notice the fact that the  147honda element 148 is indeed an old trend coming back  about fifty sixty years ago  give or take  the primary structure of most cars was boxy  boxy frame  boxy lights if you 146re getting it  it 146s not a completely original design  why do you need to know this  well in my own opinion  i think it was a small mistake on  147honda 146s 148 part for the car they made  they created a cars image that was an image of almost all cars some years ago  but that style died  and for a reason i would guess because 133those cars weren 146t all that sharp  meaning that  147honda 148 did this just to put a car out there  they make a car that has an old trend  but they don 146t even make a single thing about the car special or unique in any way  just to clear that up  and i heard a rumor from somewhere that the honda element in fact was designed following the prints of a old milk truck 133weird b  questions that will be answered   i what is the msrp for a 4wd ex honda element  highest model i i how does the car handle i i what options are available i i what caliber of safety is this car of i i will this car last is this car a worth while investment i i is this car fit for me and my mid sized family i b  handling   handling is what you would expect of a car of this size  i turned  stopped  went and parked  truly i couldn 146t find anything special than that of the honda civic  the only thing that did shine was the four wheel drive  it started better and it seemed to pull itself up hills effortlessly  also  i have lived in numerous states of varying climates on the east coast  and i can tell you by personal experience  it is a good thing to own a 4 wheel drive car when a blizzard rolls in  specifically pennsylvania  however the handling is not quite affected by the 4 wheel drive as much as you would think  you do not stop better  turning is not affected to a point you could notice and the car doesn 146t park tighter or is easier to maneuver  of course  4 wheel drive doesn 146t make you godlike so if you don 146t need 4 wheel drive  save some cash and go a different direction driving the  147honda element 148 is like a mix from driving something as a go kart  extremely maneuverable  and very easy to control and responsive  or a hummer  bulky  heavy  not as responsive  or something that can start and stop as quick  so in the middle would be the honda element  excellent starting  good stopping  good turning  great parking  fairly maneuverable and quite responsive handling is what makes this car a worthwhile burden to let a good 20 000 dollars out your pocket  great in all categories  and starts very well if you are purchasing the 4 wheel drive ex dx b  the interior comfort and the others   i must say  it is a beautiful interior  especially with black leather seats and a silver dash board  it 146s a very modernized interior and i greatly approved of it  the dashboard  the instrument panels and gauges were placed very well  if anything i would praise honda for their work on the interior of the honda element  and if you pick the ex with the proper accessories and options  the element 146s interior is a thing of beauty  except the flaw of comfort 133 i comfort   well  just because it 146s nice looking  doesn 146t mean it has to be comfortable  and in this case  it couldn 146t be anymore true  after a few minutes of sitting in the driver 146s seat  the seat that should be made with the most comfort since the driver is the driver  my butt was friggin 146 soar  i would shift from side to side to help  but the seats are just way to stiff whether i was spoiled from more comfortable leather seats i don 146t know  all i know is the honda elements seats could have been more comfortable  and definitely would have been better if they actually were more comfortable  i can 146t find a huge difference with the fabric and leather  but i think i can feel the fabric absorb slightly more therefore being softer  and more comfortable i others   well  there are some attractive catches that come with the honda element  such as the complete folding seats  front and back  why you would ever want to fold all the seats down i don 146t know  but it 146s cool right because it 146s there and you can go ahead and do it for fun and then there is the folding out doors  a new thing honda has done  which open out in opposite ways  what does this do  it does 133nothing  it might save some space of clearance between the front and back seats  and it allows you to open the entire car for yourself if you were planning to vacuum it  or have it inspected  whatever you want b engine mileage  i fought myself wondering whether or not i should mention the engines power  because if you were even interested in purchasing this car the last thing you would have considered would be the engine  but hey  it would be nice for you to have a vague peek at what the honda element 146s engine can provide so 133it 146s your average sized 6 cylinder engine  maybe a little smaller than a normal 6 cylinder engine because it is 2 4 liters  displacement  and i was surprised to find out the honda element was not a weak engine  it just wasn 146t special with it 146s fair torque and 160 horse engine  from looks alone you would think a car such as the honda element would be a weak sedan  but 133it 146s not  checking my mileage with the honda element  i was getting a good 30 35miles per gallon  you can consider this good  since i drove about in the city with a lot of stop go traffic  also to mention  this car is four wheel drive  getting the two wheel drive model would raise you gas mileage considerably  but don 146t forget you 146ll be sacrificing control for distance well the car is fair for it 146s gas mileage  but in the end it 146s just good  because the car is most definitely not fuel conservative  or have a hybrid 4 cylinder engine  so don 146t expect to be amazed  you 146ll get best performance with this car if you live possibly in the country  flat land  don 146t have to much uneven land to navigate  or forced stops  traffic lights  intersections b  safety   safety is an extremely important factor in a car  especially one on the nimble side  i am glad to say that the honda element is fairly safe  with no awards  or 4 star awards  considering the way it was created if you notice the passenger driver side doors  you 146ll see that they open out with no reinforcements  it can make someone to wonder what a side impact would do to the car people inside  well the car 146s doors are in fact very secure  when you close the doors steel beams inside the doors lock together  go ahead and try to nudge them open or try and pull to make them sway  hondas employees will let you do as you please if you feel the need to prove something to yourself  and you are willing to buy it if you break it then there are some safety features that are most definitely found in all cars of good quality  such as the four wheel anti lock abs brakes  and brake turning assists  all so vague that you would never know it was there unless someone was to take it away  in my opinion  all good cars have this  and honda has made a good car that is safe enough to sustain damage  while being versatile enough to never have to be in that situation   by the way  don 146t be cheap  get the front side airbags and all that i mentioned  since all of it is an added safety option i  options      4wd automatic transmission front side airbags  nighthawk black pearl exterior  side steps  door visor  sunroof  security system  fog lamps  wear tough floor mats  burnt black leather seats  black interior  powered windows  am fm and cd player  air conditioning   147most of the things mentioned were completely optional  while others were your average package that would come with the car 148  these are not my options  but the options of the car i test drove to see what the element was all about msrp    22 138  not bad for a car that seats four b  wrap up   to make it simple  there is always some specific part of a car or trait that makes it stand out  a hummer is big  a yugo is crappy  and a mini is small and fuel efficient  as far as the honda element goes  the master trait would be cargo space  for such a small car  the cargo space is unbeatable  it is just about as big as any suv trunk  and definitely bigger than any suv trunk that has a third row of seats hogging room so there you have it  the honda element  an amazingly average car  made by the people at honda who were trying to think outside the box 133but all they did was make a box i hope you enjoyed this review  and that it will be useful to you at sometime place  ,different old trend hand element would call new design different yes argue fact new design hand

534,camera, first of all  let me say i had never even held a digital camera until my ricoh rdc 6000 arrived at 3 00 pm one afternoon  by 4 30 pm i was emailing pictures of the cats to my husband at work  within 24 hours i had 70 pictures of vacation bible school up on the internet for the parents to see  it just doesn t get much easier than this  now  let me back up a little  when i first opened the box and saw all the cables and books  i thought   i can t wait for my husband to get home to figure this out  as i started handling the camera and looking at the literature  i thought  well  at least i can get the battery charged before ted gets home  can you see where this is going  instead of trying to figure out everything at once i just kept solving little  how to  problems and the next thing you know  i had taken a picture of the box the camera came in the ricoh rdc 6000 can be overwhelming when you first open the box  there is so much more than just a camera in there  in addition to the camera i found cable for usb connection cable for serial connection cable for television connection ac adapter power cord for ac adapter rechargeable battery 8 mb smartmedia memory card converter cable for round serial port  i think that s what it is camera case camera strap operation manual software manual battery manual  the battery has its own manual software cd for windows software cd for macs registration questionnaire technical service document a packet of offers and advertisements fifteen minutes after opening the box i had all these parts and manuals and documents spread out on my kitchen table  i attached the strap  inserted the battery  and plugged in the ac adapter  since i could turn the camera on now and i did not have to wait until the battery was fully charged  i thought i d take a few pictures  a quick glance at the operation manual  i found the large dial on the top of the camera  turned it to picture taking mode and snapped away  another check of the manual  i turned the dial to playback mode  and scrolled through the pictures i had just taken  there was no stopping me now  i turned that dial one more time to delete mode and started over  after a few minutes of this i wanted to email the pictures to my husband so i got the software manual and the windows cd  following the very simple instructions i installed the usb driver  the ricoh camera utility and a photo editing software called arcsoft  i attached the usp cable to the computer and the camera  turned that large dial on top of the camera to pc mode  opened the ricoh utility and followed the directions  i now had  jpg files on my hard drive  just treat these as you would any other  jpg file  you can use photo editing software to edit them  attach them to email  upload them to various photo storing websites  whatever you fancy  since i wanted to take pictures of vacation bible school the next day  it was now time to figure out more of the bells and whistles of this camera  since many of you will find all the details boring  or even incomprehensible  they are at the end of this review and can safely be skipped without losing the sense of this epinion b what i really like about this camera  using the 8 mb smartmedia card that the camera comes with and setting it to 640 x 480 normal  i can take 99 pictures and the quality is good enough to get 4  x 6  prints  the camera takes smartmedia cards up to 64 mb and in 640 x 480 economy that would be 1 690 pictures   on one card   but probably only good for wallet sized prints  it is also possible to set this camera to take pictures at 2000 x 1480 pixels  in this case  you d get 5 pictures on an 8 mb smartmedia card or 43 pictures on a 64 mb smartmedia card and could probably get a good print at 10  x 13  anyway you look at it  this was more pictures than i expected to be able to get on one smartmedia card the ricoh rdc 6000 is pocket sized at 4   x 2   x 1   it really isn t much bigger than my kodak advantix or any 35 mm camera i have owned the camera has many bells and whistles that i have yet to master including redeye reduction  playback to a tv  white balance  manual focus and focus lock  monochrome mode  protect from erasure  setting aperture priority  instead of automatic  changing iso sensitivity  interval shooting  and using an optional remote control unit  i am most definitely an amateur photographer and anything that can be set to  automatic  is set to  automatic  so much of these extras will go unused by me much of the camera is intuitive  i managed to set the date and time without ever looking at the manual  the menus on the lcd monitor are logical and easy to follow  i was up and running in just over an hour  and i had a problem installing the software that had nothing to do with ricoh that took me 30 minutes to fix the outdoor shots came out incredible  that may have something to do with the sun  the blue skies  and the total lack of clouds we have here in lubbock  but i got one picture of balloons floating in the sky that shows so much detail i can hardly believe i took it b what i don t like about this camera  the operation manual was translated from japanese  page 19 instructs you to charge the batteries  plural  before loading but on page 27  it is obvious you have to load the battery  there is only one  in order to charge it the slot for the smartmedia card has a cover that cannot be opened with your fingernail  i need a knife or nail file to get this opened  maybe it needs to be broken in but right now it is tough to open the flash cannot be used while taking motion pictures the camera case that comes with this camera holds only the camera and a smartmedia card  there is no place to store the battery in this camera case and the manual recommends removing the battery to store the camera   what i haven t decided on yet  i took 40 pictures indoors with a flash before i needed to recharge the battery  in that time i played back all of them to check for quality and deleted about 5 pictures  after the 40 pictures  i became tethered to an outlet to finish taking pictures that morning  for most projects  that s probably enough charge to take a sufficient number of pictures  but i guess i was excited about my new camera and went crazy taking pictures b most of the important details  can be safely skipped unless you are serious about buying this camera the large dial on the top has a total of six modes set mode   let s you format the smartmedia card  set the date or language  and various other functions of the camera movie mode   allows you to take short movie pictures as avi files still mode   allows you to take snap shots review mode   allows you to see the movies or pictures you have taken delete mode   can erase one or more of the files on the camera pc mode   for transferring files to the pc also on top of the camera are three buttons for flash  timer  and image quality and a small lcd panel  the flash can be always on  always off  automatic  or slow synchronized for indoor use  the self timer allows for a 10 second delay between pressing the shutter release button and actually taking the picture  there are nine image quality settings ranging from 1600 x 1200 fine to 640 x 480 economy  the lcd panel has readouts on flash mode  self timer  picture quality  battery power  redeye reduction  and recording mode  still or movie in addition to the power button  the back of the camera has six other buttons and an lcd monitor  two buttons with up and down arrows let you scroll through the menus and the files  pictures  and allow you to zoom in from 1x to 2x to 3x to 4x  the display button changes the lcd monitor display turning it off and on  to save batteries while the camera stays on  or changes the display from one picture to six pictures  the cancel  enter and menu buttons are used with the various menus in the various modes and are really self explanatory once you are in a certain mode  the lcd monitor is where you find all the important information like date  time  number of pictures on the smartmedia card  approximate number of pictures left to take  zoom level  flash mode  and focus mode the bottom of the camera had a tripod screw hole and a dial to adjust the brightness on the lcd monitor b results and recommendations  i have uploaded pictures from the camera to my computer to a photo hosting web site and they really are very good  i am no great photographer but the parents of the kids at vacation bible school were impressed  total time from camera to web site was about 20 minutes  later  i went back to my files and edited about 20 of the pictures that were too dark or too light  using microsoft photo editor software  and uploaded the new pictures to the web site  that took about 20 minutes for editing and uploading  i took a few pictures in each of the zoom modes  1x through 4x  and they seem to be as good as any other picture i took  i printed a few pictures  640 x 480 normal quality  at about 5  x 7  on regular  not photo  paper and they are acceptable  they are group shots and people are recognizable  the recommended maximum size for this quality is 4  x 6 i have taken one motion picture  uploaded the avi file  and viewed it just to see how it worked  it was quite simple  press the shutter release to start recording  press it again to stop  upload using the same ricoh utility that is used for stills  so far  i have taken advantage of one offer that came with the camera  i joined photoisland com and have received 75 mb of storage for pictures  i have not yet uploaded any pictures to them but 75 mb of storage will go a long way with only an 8 mb smartmedia card  that s close to 900 pictures i could store on their site if you are new to digital cameras and would rather not start at the low end with a limited camera  i highly recommend the ricoh rdc 6000  it is easy to use  most functions can be set to an automatic mode  and yet it is still capable of taking some very high quality pictures and videos  as you become a more advanced photographer  you can use more of the manual modes to take exactly the picture you want  and don t be overwhelmed by all the parts  cables  and papers that come in the box  it is very easy to sort out what exactly you need  ,first let say never even hold digital camera rich rd arrive pm

537,camera, the first thing you ll notice about the fuji mx 1700 is it s size its  not much bigger than a pack of cigarettes but don t let the small size fool you  this mid priced model takes pictures whose quality rival those of larger clunkier  and more expensive  2 megapixel cameras this camera has many features to admire  such as a true 3x optical zoom  as well as a 2x digital zoom  the controls are well laid out  and convenient to use  special features such as flash settings  such as red eye and delay and macro have their own buttons  making them much easier to use than similar features on cameras that make you scroll through endless menus when you want to change the settings the lithium ion batteries that this camera uses are both a blessing and curse  on the one hand  these batteries charge right in the camera  with the included charger cord  and are much smaller than 4 aa batteries  which helps keep the camera portable  on the other hand their small size gives them a bit let juice  which means that you should probably keep a spare charged up for emergency swaps if this camera has any drawback  it would be its uneven low light performance  i ve seen some other digital cameras  like some of the olympus models  that provide more consistent results when indoors under low light conditions  with the mx 1700  you won t always get top quality pictures indoors  though in most cases  they are at least satisfactory of course  staying at home shooting pictures isn t the point of this camera  if you re looking for a great digital camera that you can just slip into your pocket when you are on the go  that combines moderate price with great 2 megapixel performance  you won t find a better choice than the fuji mx 1700 br br  ,first thing notice full size much bigger pack cigarettes let small size fool mid price model take picture whose quality rival larger clunkier expensive megapixel camera camera many feature admire true optical room well digital room control well lay convenient use special feature flash settings red eye delay micro button make much easier use similar feature camera make stroll endless venus want change settings lithium ion batteries camera use bless curse one hand batteries charge right camera include charge cord much smaller batteries help keep camera portable hand small size give bite let juice mean probably keep spare charge emergency swamp camera drawback would uneven low light performance see digital camera like polypus model provide consistent result indoors low light condition always get top quality picture indoors though case least satisfactory course stay home shoot picture point camera look great digital camera slip pocket go combine moderate price great megapixel performance find better choice full br
538,camera, at the beginning of the summer i decided to purchace a digital camera  i purchaced the 318 from officemax for  200  this product is now far cheaper  probably retailing for around  150 first  let s go over some specifications  this is a 2 3 megapixel digital camera  it has a 2x digital zoom  flash  1 5   approximate  lcd display  8 megabytes of onboard memory  and a compact flash card slot  using the camera is a snap  to take a picture  simply turn the unit on  look through the viewfinder  depress the shutter button a little bit so the unit can focus  then press it all the way  and it will snap the picture  the camera displays the photo in the lcd display as it is saved to memory  speaking of memory  you will want to buy a memory card  the onboard 8 megabytes will hold about 7 highest quality photos  while a 32 megabyte card will hold almost 30 high quality images  of course  the camera can hold many  many more images at the lower quality settings   there are only 3 quality settings  unlike the cannon i used which had several  some may like the simplification  some may not  i don t mind it  with the 64 megabyte card i purchaced  the camera can take 70 high quality pictures  120 medium  and almost 1 000 low quality  800x600  pictures once you ve taken the pictures  looking at them is a snap  just push in the wheel at the top of the camera  and turn the wheel  like the wheel at the top of a mouse  to view the images  you can create a digital print order form  delete images  view thumbnails  or get into the camera setup via this area  navigation is extremely easy and straightforward  someone doesn t need to be skilled at computers or photography to use this camera for the price  the photo quality is excellent  the highest quality setting will give you nice 5x7 prints  but going higher then that when printing will degrade quality  a word about batteries  i use ni mh batteries  but the camera accepts four standard aa batteries  i reccomend getting a few nimh batteries and a charger to save money  and the environment of course  there are a few  issues  i ve encountered with the camera gripe 1  slow saving  the camera takes between 1 and 4 seconds between shots to save the image it just took  when taking a lot of pictures  this delay becomes irritating after awhile gripe 2  few bells and whistles  the camera comes with a 2x zoom  10 second timer  quality settings  flash options  auto  red eye  forced flash  no flash  a screen to use as a viewfinder and picture viewer  a normal viewfiner  and a compact flash slot  that s about it  i wish it had more options  like moving pictures around  stamping a date  etcetera gripe 3  macro photos  i do some nature photography that requires close ups  unfortunately  the camera cannot do this very well  the closest it can focus is about 5 inches from the subject  however  this shouldn t cause problems for most users gripe 4  usb transfers  sending photos to the computer through the usb port is slow  i m not sure why this is  it takes about 8 minutes to send 64 megabytes of data to the computer from the camera conclusion overall  this is a very nice little camera  however  someone who s vying to become a professional photographer won t like this camera a lot  but  for the moms and dads out there  students  or business men and women  this camera should make you happy  ,begin summer decide purchase digital camera purchase officemax product far cheaper probably retail around first let go specification megapixel digital camera digital room flash approximate lead display megabytes board memory compact flash card slot use camera snap take picture simply turn unit look viewfinder depress shutter button little bite unit focus press way snap picture camera display photo lead display save memory speak memory want buy memory card board megabytes hold highest quality photo megabyte card hold almost high quality image course camera hold many image lower quality settings

539,camera, my wife bought me this camera a few weeks before our baby was born so that we could instantly share pictures of our first born to family that is spread throughout the country  she knows my penchant for researching all purchases  so presented me with the  quot o k quot  to go buy one after doing my research so  to the internet  epinions of course  and to a local camera store  camera world  i went  why did i end up with the   fuji finepix 1400 i b  price  functionality and quality b price  retail for the finepix 1400 is  290  but i found it at the chase manhattan shopping site for  190  even with a couple of upgrades  32mb flash card  8 rechargeable batteries and a charger  my price was still under the retail price  my wife had put me on a  300 budget  so this was perfect for me  i found that digital cameras run in the  200    900 range  i was very surprised that my  190 bought such a fine camera b features  the fuji finepix 1400 comes standard with the following i 3x autofocus power zoom    perfectly fine for any indoor household type zooming needs  not great for trying to zoom in on a wide receiver on a football field  however i 4mb smartmedia storage card    this only holds about 15 or 18 pictures  so unless you download pictures after every picture taking session  you ll want to upgrade this to a 32mb version  you can find a 32mb card for about  50 on ebay  and this will hold about 150 pictures  more than enough to get you through several photo sessions i 1280 x 960 image file resolution    good resolution for pictures up to 5x7  if you re interested in blowing your pictures up to 8x10 or larger  i d recommend a camera with a higher resolution  however  i m perfectly happy with the finepix s resolution for my everyday internet sharing purposes  i have developed one of the pictures in 8x10 format  and although it looks good from a distance  you can really see the pixels up close i 1 6 inch liquid crystal display    awesome  you take a picture and 1 2 second later it is shown on this incredibly sharp display  not only that  but you can choose to view from this so you can take pictures without having your eye directly on the viewfinder  it s like a little video camera  but not recording  when viewing a picture  you can zoom in and out and the display exposes new levels of detail upon each closer zoom   multi frame playback feature    lots and lots of options on how to view pictures  one by one  thumbnails  zoomed in  zoomed out  etc  you can also lock photos so they aren t inadvertently deleted  navigating through the pictures is very easy  and the buttons to do so are clearly marked and large enough to accommodate large fingers i usb enabled    this is very important to get  do not buy serial cable cameras  as it takes forever to port to a computer  the usb cable is lightening fast  to view the 120 pictures on my camera right now  it only takes about 3 seconds for all to load  the software fuji provides is simple to install and simple to use  consists of a driver for windows 98 or windows 2000  a photo editor and a photo viewer  i ve never used the photo editor  however  because i m a fan of

540,camera, i was in my local camera shop a few days ago looking for a small carrying case for my new digital camera  i spend more time in photo and electronics stores than the average canon representative  and i was chatting with a friendly salesman about digital cameras  i had barely noticed the middle aged man standing a few yards away staring blankly into a showcase  the salesman excused himself from our conversation  and went to proffer assistance to this gentleman  our mystery man responded   quot no  thanks  but i d like to talk to you  if you don t mind quot  pointing a friendly finger in my direction  as it turned out  this stranger  chris  he introduced himself  had just purchased the new sony dsc f505v digital camera  and wanted to pay me  60 to spend 3 hours showing him how to use the camera  he turned out to be an ex wedding photographer  turned photo hobbyist who had just made his first foray into digital photography  as an avid photographer  i figured it would make for a good epinions review  plus i can never turn down an offer to play with new technology  so off we went to the streets of new jersey for a little photographic adventure  i also took my 3 month old nikon coolpix 990 with me to see how it would stand up to sony s newest competitor  chris pulled out his manual while i played with the controls  and by the time he had read over the first 3 pages  i had the camera figured out  this was not completely attributable to my camera skills  i must admit  sony has done a nice job laying out the controls with good access to menus and fast access to basic functions  after spending what turned out to be 5 hours learning  teaching  and photographing with the dsc f505v  i can say that sony came pretty close to producing a great camera let s start with the sony s strong points  the carl zeiss lens produces excellent results with great color saturation  the 5 times optical zoom provides great range  though it operates a little slowly  and makes it much more versatile in telephoto situations  up to the 35mm equivalent of 190mm  this digicam wins points in my book by including a good amount of creative control  and i love the manual focusing ring at the front of the lens  all was going well on our photo shoot when suddenly the digipoo hit the fan  fifty minutes into the afternoon and already the freshly charged lithium ion battery was dead  luckily he had the good sense to spend an additional  50 for a spare battery  but with a two hour charge time  sony includes 1 battery and the charger  and less than an hour s operation  we had encountered the dsc f505v s first weakness  this flaw is worsened by the fact that you cannot use any other types of batteries in the unit  and since there is no viewfinder  there is no way of saving power by turning off the display  after another hour s use  some intense reading  of both the manual and some reviews  and uploading the images to a computer  other flaws began to surface  the included 8mb memorystick filled up very quickly  for  1000  sony should have included a 16mb card  the manual is virtually impossible to follow  and the camera is a little too bulky for it s features  flash performance was also a little below average  and i thought sony should have included a more versatile set of metering options  center weighted and spot are your only choices  i also think that sony slightly misrepresented the dsc f505v by advertising it as a 3 7 megapixel camera  what the camera actually does is use a 3 3 mp  2048x1536  ccd  which is partly blocked from the lens by the camera s design  this means the camera is only actually capturing 2 7 megapixels  1856x1392  what the camera then does  albeit better than some earlier digital cameras  is interpolate the image out to 2240 by 1680  creating a 3 7 megapixel image  this final image does not produce quite as good a result as true 3 34 megapixel camera when the second battery died  55 minutes out of this one  i showed chris my coolpix 990  check out my user page for a complete review  after an hour or so he had the basic functions down  and he was enamored with the nikon s swivel head and control system  we talked about some of the obvious advantages  true 3 34 megapixel resolution  compact design  pro features  inclusion of a viewfinder  and the ability to use aa batteries  and it was a no brainer for him  right then  we drove to the store where he bought the dsc f505v  and exchanged it for their second to last nikon 990  i talked to him again several days later  and he was as thrilled with his new coolpix as i was br br  ,local camera shop days ago look small carry case new digital camera spend time photo electronics store average canon representative chat friendly salesman digital

541,auto, i bought the 2001 integra gs coupe  at  back in january 2001  6 months before it is replaced by the all new rsx  it 146s the last of its generation  first of all  i have to admit that i should have waited for 6 more months and get an all new rsx at about same price or got a mt gsr type r  nonetheless  i enjoy the ride of this car since it is my first purchased vehicle and didn 146t drive much before  i didn 146t do much research on different models vendors  i did consider toyota celica  mitsubishi eclipse  honda accord coupe  i didn 146t look at european vendor because my budget was just slightly more than  20k  plus i don 146t believe reliability on european cars  except mercedez benz  celica and eclipse were ruled out because of awkward styling and reliability respective while accord coupe is too  roomy  and too sedan style  the only sporty car left in my list was the legendary integra  and given the reliability rating of honda acura  it was the best choice exterior i love the styling  even better than the new rsx  it 146s has a traditional japanese hot rod  sporty styling  but without over aggressive as eclipse and celica   of course  integra can have very aggressive exterior after all those after market body kits  its smooth front end  with 4 round headlights gives an  intelligent  outlook  which is well received by young professionals  though this exterior has been for integra since 94  which was amazing back then  it still looks good nowadays  i won 146t say the styling is out dated  but rather a bit boring since there are so many integras out there on the street  after 8 years in production interior in general  i think the interior is what bring down the rating of this car  there is not much upgrade  except from cassette to cd player  since the 3rd generation of integra came out in 94  it may be cool looking back then  but it 146s out dated after 8 years  the console is comparable to the accord 2 generations back  the cd player is kind of hard to reach from driver seat and you need to lean a bit forward to reach the cd player  the dash board looks good though not excited  it 146s easy to read during day time even under bright sunlight  at night it looks ok as well don 146t see any reflection from the windshield  thanks to the dash broad is mounted kind of deep inside the console engine integra ls gs comes with 1 8l 140hp 6400rpm and 125lb ft 4200rpm  red zone is at around 6800rpm  non vtec  it provides just enough power for daily drive  as i said  i should have bought a gsr or type r which provides 170 and 195hp respectively with around  2k 3k more  one may ask why not get a muscle car like mustang with cheaper price but higher hp  personally  i admire the way japanese and german built engines  probably due to many racing events in those countries have placed limitations on engine size  japanese and german automakers have traditions to build efficient and sophisticated engines  they can boost the engine to produce 100 hp on each liter  eg  s2000  integra type r  m3  and even the enzo  honestly  i don 146t know how much technology ford has put in the mustang engine in which only produce 190hp from 3 8l and 320hp from 4 6l handling since my car is automatic transmission  i can 146t say much about handling  however  some sharp corning has been quite stable and responsive on integra  not sure if it is because i install the front strut bar  the same oem one installed on gsr  compare with rsx  test drive  apparently  integra showed better stability on cornering  on rsx  in order to save space in front  the engine is mounted reversely and more towards the bumper  the result shifts the weight towards front of the front axles and this causes the more under steering  road holding is very good on integra  thanks to 4 independent double wishbone suspensions acceleration acceleration is something really kills an at integra  i don 146t have a real figure on my integra for 0 60mph  but most figures on the web showing around 10secs  a result of non vtec and 4 gears  instead of 5 on mt  the engine is especially hard to pick up the speed in 2nd and 3rd gears braking integra equips with 4 disc brakes and abs with 4 wheel speed sensors  because the car is lighter than average sedan  the brake is quite responsive suspension integra equipped with 4 independent double wishbone suspension which offers excellent response and handling  i also installed front strut bar from acura  the same one comes with gsr models  driver can really feel the road  but provide reasonably comfort  which makes it fun to drive on local or highway  i would say the suspension is sporty but not harsh roominess well  as a coupe  we can 146t expect much on roominess  there is not much space in fact for passengers  the driver seat is most suitable for 5 14610 146 146 people with average size  for me  i have to push the driver seat all the way back so that my leg won 146t hit the steering wheel when pressing the brake pedal  even after i set the steering wheel to its highest position  thus the passenger seat behind is basically useless  the trunk is large enough to put 1 mid size and 1 large luggage  but can accommodate more when folder down on passenger seats tires the original tires comes with my integra are michelin xgt v4  ultra performance  most people don 146t have a good review on these tires though  so far it is ok with me  and i don 146t think i haven 146t pushed them to the limit yet equipments as expected from most honda vehicles  it provided most equipments as standard  which is good for me as a first time buyer  the integra gs comes with standard leather trim  moonroof  cd player  6 speakers  immobilizer  alloy wheels  leather steering wheel  power windows  and power locks headlights though the 4 round front headlights provide distinctive look  it does not provide adequate brightness on near ground  the focus seems to be on distance objects but not on foreground near the car  sometimes i don 146t see a bump till 15 20 feet away  that 146s why i installed fog light to compensate this  as well as for cool looking  i used piaa extreme whites and piaa super plasma for low beams and fog lights respectively  which are much better than average halogen bulbs safety only front driver and passenger airbags are provided which provide average protection  2000 and 2001 integras have installed 2 strong steel side impact beams on each front door to protect passenger from fatal injury  4 disc brakes with abs provide reasonably active safety reliability after driving the car for 2 5 years  i don 146t see any major mechanical problem at all on my integra  here is the list of problem i encountered so far 1  key got locked in steering column  it turns out to be my 3rd party security system has screwed up the circuit  not the problem from my car  acura dealer was very helpful to diagnose the problem for me 2  passenger seat is a bit out of the track  this got fixed with any charge  under warranty acura provides 4 year warranty which is better than average japanese made automobiles insurance prepare to live with high premium on integra  from statistics  integra appeals theft seven times more than average sedans  partly due to its high resell value and popularity  and also because most of its mechanical components can be used on civic without much modification   we all know that civic has been a popular modification target for street rocket and that create a huge demand on integra components in conclusion  i enjoy and love my integra very much  my only complaint is the horsepower  as i said  i should have bought the gsr  170hp  or even type r  195hp  if you are looking for a used fun car to drive with reliability  i would definitely recommend integra  ,buy integral couple back january months replace new last generation first admit wait months get new price get mt gr type nonetheless enjoy ride car since first purchase

542,auto, i have driven chevy  dodge  gmc  and even harvester trucks  by far i still find my ford pickups the best there is  i bought a f250 super duty extended cab 4x4 pickup with the 7 3 diesel  i love this engine  with my heavily laden camper  my family  dog  and stuff it just cruised up and down hills and mountain passes without ever slowing down  previously my favorite ford engine had been the 300 6 cylinder  it was extremely reliable  but it just did not have much power at upper highway speeds when loaded  with the diesel engine i set the cruise control at about 65 mph and never slowed down while traveling through the passes on the interstate 5 from oregon to california  the fuel economy is just about what you would expect from this class of engine  16 18 miles per gallon  i suppose my chief complaint about the truck would be how noisy the diesel engine is  i guarantee that if ranger walker had this engine he would not sneak up on anybody with it unless they were completely deaf  of course  the f250 is just a bit bumpy without any load in the back it s a 4x4 super duty  i ve taken the trunk onto the sandy beaches at long beach and driven up and down the coast line with no problems  the four wheel drive just goes  when wandering up into the cascades i just put it in four wheel drive and never have a problem in the snow  all in all  in spite of the engine noise and unloaded intestine rattling ride  i love this truck  if you need a truck this size or just think you do like me  this is the right one     ,drive dodge even harvest trunks far still find ford picket best buy super duty extend cab pick diese love engine heavily lade hamper family dog stuff bruise hill mountain pass without ever slow previously favorite ford engine cylinder extremely reliable much power upper highway speed load diese engine set cruise control may never slow travel pass interstate oregon california fuel economy would expect class engine miles per gallon suppose chief complaint truck would noisy diese engine guarantee ranger walker engine would speak anybody unless completely deaf course bite bump without load back super duty take trunk onto sandy reach long beach drive coast line problems four wheel drive go wander cascade put four wheel drive never problem snow spite engine noise unload intestine rattle ride love truck need truck size think like right one
543,camera, the olympus d 380 has a street price of only  199 giving you quality photos in a 2 megapixel camera  this camera is made to fit into your pocket or a purse weighing in at only 6 7 ounces and the size of 4 8 inches wide by 2  6 inches in height by 1 8 inches thick  this camera is made to be a point and shoot camera  it will automatically focus for you when you press the shutter button down half way  if you push the button all the way  it will snap off a photo for you the neat feature of this little beauty is it has a built in protective cover over the lens that slides to the side and at the same time turns on the camera  sliding the cover back over the lens turns it off  the cover being built on the camera prevents you from loosing it compared to a pop of and on cover another nice part is it comes with an 8mb  a href content 44580114052 smartmedia memory card a  and it has 2mb of internal memory built in to give a few photo shots of storage if needed not only can you take beautiful photos  you can also take movies with the olympus d 380 b  movies  b the olympus d 380 lets you take movies in two different modes at 15fps  frames per second  320 x 240 hq mode or 160 x 120 sq mode the camera uses the quicktime movie mode for recording and records up to 15 seconds at a time in the hq mode and 60 seconds in the sq mode the only drawback i see for the movies is there is no video out for viewing the movies or photos on your tv set  though you can view them on the camera and a computer b  photos  b the olympus d 380 offers you a wide variety of photos to shoot from to give you a photo large enough to print as an 8 by 10 inch b shq mode  1600 x 1208 pixel images in the jpeg format b hq mode  1600 x 1200 pixel images in the jpeg format b sq1 mode  1024 x 768 pixel

taking your photos b optical  the optical viewfinder is a real image viewfinder that covers the field of about 80  inside the viewfinder you can also see if the photo is in focus and if the flash is ready to be used b lcd  the olympus d 380 has a small but effective 1 5 inch color tft lcd used for photo taking  movie taking  camera setup and photo   movie viewing b  the lens  b the only drawback here is it a fixed lens of 4 5mm   35mm lens equivalent in 35mm photography  though it does provide a digital zoom of 2 5x in the shq  hq   sq1 modes and a 5x in the sq2 mode it is an all glass lens f 4 0 with 5 elements in 5 groups  you can adjust the aperture at f 4 0 or f 8 0 focus for the lens is 24 inches to infinity and in the macro mode you can get as close as 10 inches b  the flash  b the olympus d 380 has a built in flash with a range of 10 inches to 8 2 feet it has modes for auto flash  auto flash with red eye reduction  fill in flash  slow shutter synchronization flash  1st curtain effect  slow shutter synchronized flash  1st curtain effect w  red eye reduction  and flash off recycle time for the flash between photos is about 6 seconds b  other features  b shutter speeds 1 2

connect usb date   time calendar b  the batteries  b the camera comes with alkaline aa batteries that once they are used up they must be thrown away i recommend buying a ni mh charger and 8 ni mh rechargeable batteries  you only need 4 batteries to use the camera but this will give you a spare charged set on hand  cost for 8 batteries and charger between  40 to 50 b  compatible with   b the olympus d 380 is made for windows 98 revision 2  me  2000 pro and xp for the macintosh   mac os 8 6 or better b  what you get   b the olympus d 380 digital camera a wrist strap batteries 8mb  a href content 44580114052 smartmedia memory card a a usb cable cd with software and drivers instruction manual  software guide and registration     my test results  b b movies  the movies are rather small but remember this camera is a still photo camera so the movies are an extra feature added  the 320 x 240 hq mode is rather small on the computer but it produces a nice 15 second movie without any sound  the 160 x 120 sq mode is too small for me but it produces a longer movie of about 60 seconds and seems clearer because of the smaller size  movie shots need to be taken in well lighted areas b photo color  the photo color is great especially in outdoor shots and well lighted indoor shots b sharpness  the photos seem to have pretty good clarity but when closely looking around the corners they seem to get a little distorted  printing up the photo on a 4 x 6 inches print produced a flawless photo  printing the same photo on an 8 x 10 showed a slight distortion but it is hardly noticeable unless you look for it b night shots  the night shots outside are pretty good as long as the subject isn 146t too far away and that there is some decent lighting around  the night shots do tend to produce a little more noticeable grain than the day time shots b outdoor shots  about the best of all the shots taken  bright and colorful  in some instances the sun may be too bright  then you need to compensate with the exposure compensation to get your best results  using the flash outdoors in the auto mode also helps in producing great photos that are up close b flash shots  the flash is alright  it just isn 146t made for any distance shots  under most flash shots within about 10 feet the photos turned out rather well  incandescent lighting is tough sometimes and i find the setting the camera on the incandescent whit balance setting helps  you may have to experiment with settings to get your best results b batteries  i was using the ni mh rechargeable batteries and did take 150 shots before recharging and it still had power to shoot a few more b use  the olympus d 380 is about as easy as it comes to using and setting up to use with your computer  you can make some minor adjustments to get the camera to your preference but then it is basically just point at the subject  hold the shutter button down half way for the camera to auto focus for you and then push the button all the way down to snap the photo  the software and driver loaded without any problems on my computer using windows me and uploading the photos to the computer are automatic once i connect the usb cable to the camera and computer b  overall  b this is a camera that a lot of people will enjoy for the price  ease of use and photo quality this is a great camera for the first timer or the person on a budget wanting a good quality digital camera i do recommend buying the ni mh rechargeable batteries and a 64mb or 128mb smartmedia card b thank you for reading my review    b  print your

544,camera, i was never that interested in getting a digital camera  yeah  i thought they looked nice and the concept was good  they were always too expensive though  for my birthday this year my girlfriend epinionid mookasaurs  bought me the kodak millenium edition camera the millenium package came with an 8 mb picture card and a usb removable disk  the 8 mb card will hold about 26 pictures with this camera  very similar to the 25 pictures i was accustomed too with my advantix  i wasn t quite content with that  when i go places i usually bring a couple rolls of film  for use around the house 8 mb is plenty  i can take 26 pictures  load them on my hard drive and go for another round  if i m away though i can do that  i was able to acquire a 32 mb picture card and now i have plenty of storage for my pictures  this card will hold 113 pictures at the highest resolution and over 250 at the lowest  i ve even heard that there is a 196 mb picture card out  that s just amazing the removable disk is very convenient  it looks like a little mouse  it connects into a usb port in your computer and you can slide your picture disk into the slot  this is much more convenient than hooking the camera up to the computer every time you want to read the disk  the setup for this was really easy and i was so close to being able to do it without the directions  of course my mom always says  people get paid good money to write those directions enough about the gizmos and gadgets  i m sure you want to know about the camera  the camera is extremely easy to use  i still haven t had to crack open the instruction booklet yet  it only takes a few minutes to set the time  date and any other settings like resolution  put the picture card in and you re ready to go  for those who are use to a regular camera you ll notice that the digital camera is much heavier  part of this is because of the 4 aa batteries required to operate the camera  flip the power on  set the camera to capture mode  aim and shoot  the picture will then come up on the lcd screen on the back of the camera  you have the option to delete it if you want  i suggest you don t delete pictures till you need the space  even bad pictures are nice to look at later on in life  you can always download them to your computer and not have to worry about them taking space on your picture card  you can also set the camera to review mode and look at all of the pictures you have taken so far  you re allowed to delete pictures in this mode also the camera has three different flash modes  on  off and red eye reduction  the flash is extremely bright so don t look directly into the light  there is also a timer on the camera so you can set it down and get into the picture yourself  the zoom lens on the camera is a very nice feature to take close ups  there are a couple of downsides to the digital camera  with regular cameras you can take pictures one after the other  the digital camera has like a 10 second pause where it is writing the picture to the disk  this can cause you to miss some good pictures  it also chews up batteries at a good rate  i ve gone through a set of batteries already in just three weeks  the only other problem i can see is the inconvenience of having to get pictures developed  all of the options there are to get them developed seem really expensive overall i suggest investing in one of these cameras  you can email all your pictures to friends and family  put them on your web site or just keep them on your computer for your personal viewing br br  ,never interest get digital camera yeah think look nice concept good always expensive though birthday year girlfriend epinionid mookasaurs buy today millennium edition camera millennium package come mb picture card

547,camera, i ve been doing photography for 25 years  mostly with 35mm slrs  i own 2 nikon f2 cameras and 8 nikkor lenses  and have always been a  nikon man  this company has products which  in my opinion  are far superior to all but the most expensive  german made  cameras  and in any event nikon cameras are unequaled in durability and flexibility  next time you see a newspaper photographer  you will probably notice he she is using nikon equipment  that s no accident  nikons stand up to abuse better than anything else i bought the cp5000  first  for the 5 megapixel feature  as a long time user of nikkor lenses  i am used to outstanding image quality  and i demand it in my photography  i have found that this camera delivers it  when i use it within its limitations  more on that later  also  as i mentioned  the nikon name means quality to me  and i haven t been disappointed with the 5000 the first thing i noticed when i anxiously opened the box for the first time is that this camera is tiny  almost too small for my liking  as i am a big guy with big hands  but i got used to it  moreover  as i am used to the heavy  all mechanical f2  it was disconcerting to take a picture and not hear and feel that shutter cycle and the mirror slam home  but this  too  i got used to  an f2 with motor drive and battery pack can weigh close to 5 pounds  depending on the lens used  this is definately no f2 the technology that went into this camera is nothing short of amazing  i cannot believe the things it can do  and the flexibility of modes of operation is impressive  in this respect  this camera is every bit a nikon  a lot of the features are probably availiable on other digital cameras in the same price range  but i was used to a mechanical camera  so i was impressed the lens is excellent  although i am somewhat disappointed with the edge sharpness in extreme close ups  please keep in mind  however  that i am used to using high end  professional quality lenses  the flexibility of the cp5000 lens is such that it cannot do everything equally well  the very fact that this is a 3x wide to tele zoom  that can focus to 3 4  is amazing  it is unfair to compare it with my 55mm f 3 5 micro nikkor  while center sharpness is outstanding  if you intend to do a lot of extreme close ups  don t expect it to perform like a dedicated close up lens some things that i like  the incredible image quality  and i am a very demanding user in that respect  the 8x10 prints i produce with this camera get a lot of comments like  that s a digital camera  wow  in spite of my initial reservations about the small size  i can put it in my pocket and take candids of my drunk friends at the bar  i can t do that with an f2  the abundant features  like multi mode auto exposure  white balance preset  you set the white balance by reading a white card  which makes it possible to have a perfect setting in any light conditions  very cool  also  manual focus override is useful for extreme close ups  this camera does more stuff than 95  of users will ever need  but whatever your requirements  you will find features that make you say  wow  that s cool  this camera has a solid feel  the body is made of magnesium  and in spite of it s tiny size  it has a nice heft  you can tell it s not a plastic camera  the swiveling lcd screen is great for shooting at waist level  or other strange positions  great for candid photography some complaints  the flash sensor is placed in just about the worst spot imagineable for someone with big hands  it s easy to get used to if you use the camera regularly  but if i hand it to someone else i have to warn them to keep their fingers out of the way    the autofocus is slow  so if you pick up the camera and try to  grab  a quick shot  you sometimes miss it while the camera focuses  if you prefocus the camera by half pressing the shutter button  however  there is almost no shutter lag at all  this is a lot better than other digital cameras  this point deserves some discussion  i notice that many reviews say that this camera has no shutter lag at all  while others say thet the lag is unacceptable  this camera does not have shutter lag   it has autofocus lag  there is new firmware  that i have not installed yet  that is supposed to improve autofocus performance  i hope it helps that s about all  it is a fact that no matter what camera you buy  something better will be availiable in a few months that will be better  and the one you bought will be availiable for a couple of hundred dollars less  overall  i m happy with the cp5000  the quality and features are worth the money  ,photography years mostly mm sir union camera nikkor lenses always union man company products opinion far superior expensive german make

548,auto, this review is being written in appreciation of the time spent by others doing reviews that i have read  there is information readily available about what features are available on the lexus ls430 so i won t spend time rehashing that  i recently purchased a 2002 ls430 with the ultra package  april 2002  my previous car was a 1999 lexus gs400 that i traded for the ls430  prior to that i traded a 1997 acura rl3 5 for the gs400  and a 1993 bmw 750il  which i traded for the acura  i traded the bmw for the acura because at 55k miles it started to cost serious money to maintain for stuff that never should have failed at that mileage  bmw s attitude was that a car is a machine and machines break  thus the switch to something japanese  after i told a dealer that sold both acura and mercedes that reliability was important to me he said forget the germans i took a 550 mile trip with the lexus ls430 the day after i bought it and my impressions are based on that  i got 24 5 mpg when i average 80 85 mph  i got 27 mpg when i kept it to 65  at 55  pretty hard to go that slow  i got 28  mpg  pretty amazing for a 290 hp blaster  that is better than my gs400 the first thing that i noticed with the ls430 versus my gs400 was that the tightness and handling of the ls430 was not up there with the gs400  i now realized how precise the gs was  the ls is smooth though  there is no question that my trip was way more comfortable in the ls430 than it would have been with the gs400  the seats are very comfortable  the leather is soft and supple and i liked the fact that the bottom portion of the seat could be adjusted for leg length  giving a deeper seat  i am 6 1  so the extra length helped  i did a three hour and 45 minute stretch without a stop and i was not wiped out i live a couple of miles out a country road with a few nice curves  having driven these curves so many times  and having challenged them with all three of my previous cars  i would say that the gs400 was best on them  the bmw 750il next  then the ls430  followed by the acura rl3 5  while the ls430 had noticeable body roll  i never lost confidence in my ability to hold the curve like i would in the acura  switching the air suspension from normal to sport mode made some difference  but not a night and day difference  the normal mode was satisfactory  the sport mode was better  neither made it a bmw 750  or a lexus gs400 the ls430 accelerates with authority  especially when going from 65 to 85 mph for a passing maneuver  the imprecise handling and lack of acceleration above 60 mph was why i abandoned the acura  which in all other respects was an outstanding car whose fit  finish  and reliability was equal to lexus  on my trip i cruised some stretches at 95 mph  and it was a breeze  the car was silky smooth and noiseless  it tracked beautifully  it was hard to believe that i was going so fast  if you punched the gas at 95 it downshifted and pulled with authority  wonderful  even the flagship bmw was not as good  in my humble opinion  although it was faster  i read a lot of comparisons on the internet about the infinity q45  the lexus ls430  and the mercedes s500 and s430 regarding power  all i can say is that all three have plenty  the mercedes s430 doesn t cut the muster though  it is noticeably slower than those others  and that is why i don t mention it anymore  i won t spend any time with this lexus ls430 wishing it had more snap  that is all that i ask i experimented with manual downshifting prior to passing on the interstate  while the lexus ls430 does not have a sequential  tiptronic  type transmission  it snicked easily from d  drive  to 4th gear without having to let up on the accelerator  the downshift was executed smoothly and quickly  quicker that a press the gas to the floor forced downshift  the automatic kick down seemed to delay a little more than i liked i weaved in and out of traffic at high speeds effortlessly  it was sweet  brakes were solid and easily controlled now about some of the goodies  the navigation system is the best i have ever seen  my wife s arura 3 2cl has a great nav system  but this one is even better  the whole u s  and most of canada comes included  my small  50 000  town in oregon is in it but is not in hers  the touch controls are easy to master for common operations  the directions it gives are right on the money and it is has great flexibility in its set up  it responds to voice commands by pushing and releasing a button on the steering column  these commands can control the nav system and the audio controls through about 150 voice commands  you can access navigation functions with one voice command that take a up to four button pushes to get to on the touch screen  a voice confirms each one  you can switch audio or map functions with a word or phrase  it does a very good job of recognizing what you are saying  and you don t have to turn the radio down to talk  with you hit the voice button it mutes the audio system before you speak  i thought that this would be a basically useless gimmick when i read about it  but having tried it out  i like it  it is definitely useful  as i have said  many of the navigation screen and touch features are configurable for convenience and preference one cool surprise that i got was that when i entered the street address of the destination that i was headed to in washington  it immediately knew what city and state it was in  i never entered the city and state  just the street address  the system navigated me there without a hitch  which was appreciated since there were numerous turns that had to be made once i exited the freeway  it got me there right on the money my brother wanted to take me to dinner at a restaurant that he had never visited  sitting in his driveway i just selected  menu  points of interest  restaurant  japanese  and bingo  it listed three in the area  one of which was the one we wanted  i selected that one and it led me there and back  cool i played with the radar based adaptive cruise control  it worked as advertised  i turned on the cruise control and hit set  a small digital display showed me the speed that i had selected  a little picture of one car following another popped up and i was locked on  if that car slowed a little  so did i  maintaining the pre set distance  if it sped up beyond my pre set speed i speeded up until i hit my preset speed then leveled off  if another car cut between me and the car i was locked in on  my speed slowed until i was separated from the cut in car by the pre set distance  if my locked on car pulled away into another lane i sped up until i hit the pre set speed or came up on another car at the right distance  you can select from three following distances with a button on the steering wheel  a graphic indicates your selection and whether you are locked on to anything on the way up to washington it started to rain  as soon as the first few drops fell the wipers took a swipe  these wipers are way cool  we passed a semi that splashed a bunch of water on my windshield  the wipers gave a frantic four wipes to clear the water then went back to occassional swipes  the nice thing about the wipers on the automatic setting is that you do not have to keep fiddling with the intermittent timing as the rain fall varies  it knows when to wipe again  wonderful i used the radar based parking assist and i can see that in some circumstances it is helpful  this system tells you if you are getting within a couple of feet of an object in the front or rear when you are moving less than 6 mph  like when you are parking  i like the fact that a nice big display flashes up on the navigation screen indicating what is going on there are lots of little touches about the ls  lights under the exterior mirrors illuminate where you step when approaching the car at night when you hit the unlock  the ignition illuminates and so does the seatbelt receptacle so you can find it in the dark  the temperature controls do an excellent job of keeping you comfortable without constant tweaking  you can set a  normal  volume level for the audio  and if you  or someone else  turn the volume up or down for some reason  one tap of a steering wheel mounted button returns you to your preferred setting  the driver can undo stuff done by backseat passengers like leaving headrests up or seats reclined  the three places to plug in a cell phone allowed me to have a radar detector plugged in and still charge both my wife s and my cell phone simultaneously  self closing doors all around  some people think self closing doors are total fluff but some elderly people or children have a problem closing car doors  a trip computer shows miles since last refueling  mpg on this tank  average mpg  instantaneous mpg  elapsed time  and more  you can view trip meter and odometer at the same time on yet another display  couldn t do that on my gs400   the japanese are finally catching on  you can record a brief  2 5 min  digital message to yourself with the touch of an overhead button  this is good for leaving yourself a message or noting a phone number while you drive  the interior door handles illuminate at night when you turn the engine off so that you can find them in the dark what are some of the misses the navigation system cannot receive a new destination while you are moving  that means that even a passenger cannot make adjustments without you stopping the car  i tended to unintentionally bump certain buttons on the steering wheel causing stuff like changing the song selection on the cd or changing from cd to am radio  the reading lights in the front are not as bright as they were in the gs400  i really liked those bright lights  the low beam headlight setting doesn t seem to aim far enough down the road  this may be dealer adjustable  pretty petty stuff huh other cars that i researched and considered before buying the ls430 were the infinity q45  the mercedes s430 and s500  and the bmw 745  of those i only test drove the benzes  i sat in a bmw 745 and went over it with a salesperson  these are all great cars  browsing lots of internet forums left me of the opinion that the german car dealerships were arrogant and not very customer oriented  i know from personal experience that bmw is not even worth talking to if you have an out of warranty problem  the mercedes prices border on just plain silly  you are talking  15 20k more for the same amount of car  don t buy that pap about superior engineering  they have good performance but the reliability lags lexus  the bmw 745 is almost like a concept car  it is full of gee whiz technology that at times seems needlessly complex  there is no way 745il buyers won t make multiple trips for warranty repairs  and heaven help them when the warranty ends  i was surprised at how many bmw 740il  not 745il  although there were a few of those  owners that i came across that traded them for a lexus ls430  reliability and dealer service were the two biggest reasons  they all said that they gave up some drivability when they switched to the lexus ls430  but it was worth it to them  bmw prices are high too  so is audi  it is a german thing  once again i point out that even the worst of these cars is a very good car  these are the cream of the crop at this point i am very happy with my choice  getting a break on price is not easy  9 1 01 jitters have made the supply low and lexus is selling all they can make  i paid  69k out of the door  no car ever made is worth that

550,auto, when bmw was first founded  the m  in bmw  has always stood for  motoren  german for engine  today  bmw makes a line of  m  cars that began with the famed m1 supercar of 1978  in 1988  the m group introduced the m5  a high performance version of the 5 series  midsize luxury car  it was powered by a 256 horsepower  6 cylinder engine  today  the m5 is a v8 powered luxury car with enough power to embarass a corvette b exterior   the m5 is very stylish  yet very understated  the 18 inch alloy wheels and m badges are the only styling features that set it apart from lesser 5 series models  new for 2002  are chrome rings around the headlights  another way to tell if an m5 is an m5 is its 4 exhaust pipes b interior   no 5 series is as quiet as a lexus in my opinion  but wind noise is kept at a bare minimum  the engine is very quiet at low rpms  at high rpms  the v8 engine can sound a bit whiny  tire roar is noticeable from the high performance tires  but not loud enough to annoy me  the instruments are easy on the eyes and the gauges glow bright red at night  the tachometer even has a variable redline  when the engine is started cold  the redline is set at a lower rpm than usual  when the engine is warmed  the redline will reset itself to the full 7 000 rpm the navigation system is a very useful piece of equipment  assuming you know how to use it  although not nearly as complex as mercedes  command navigation system  bmw incorporates audio and climate controls into the navigation system which  to me  overcomplicates what is usually a simple task up front  there is a lot of room even for tall drivers  usually  a sunroofs cut in on headroom  but this is not the case for the m5  or any 5 series for that matter  the front buckets are very supportive laterally  and extremely comfortable  the 16 way power seats also have a power lumbar adjustment  even in the back  there is enough leg room for me  the seats in the back are just as comfortable as in the rear  leather upholstery is standard  wood interior accents add a very luxurious tone to the cabin  as far as cargo room is concerned  the narrow trunk can hold 11 1 cubic feet  subpar for the class b engine   the m5 is powered by a 4 9 liter v8 engine  it produces 394 horsepower at 6 600 rpm  and 368 lb ft  of torque at 3 800 rpm  around town  torque is always there  the m5 is so strong in fact  i have to keep an eye on the speedometer almost all the time  as expected with almost 400 horses  highway response is simply amazing  most popular car magazines claim a 0 60 mph time of less than 5 seconds  so what is the punishment for that power  horrible fuel economy  epa estimate of 13 city and 21 highway indicate many pit stops per week  premium fuel is required  the only transmisson option is a 6 speed manual transmission  the clutch is perfect  not too light  yet none too stiff  the shifter feel is great b handling   despite the fact that the m5 weighs 4 024 pounds  on twisty roads  you seldom feel it  the steering is weighted just right for me  there is very little body lean in the corners  traction control is a must in snowy climates  considering that there is almost 400 horsepower at your disposal  overall  the m5 is very fun to drive b ride   although the m5 is very stiffly sprung  it actually rides quite good  only moon like road surfaces upset the m5 s amazing balance  at high speeds  the 4 000 pound bullet is extremly stable  perfect for the autobahn b reliabilty   all products from bmw are safe and reliable  but some 2000 and 2001 m5 s have been issued recalls  for more information  check out http www nhtsa gov cars problems recalls index cfm b value   the m5 is a well built  fun to drive sports car  with executive like luxury and amenities  although its  70 000 price tag suggests exlusivity  m5 is just too understated for my tastes  personally  i would prefer more styling enhancements than that of lesser 5 series cars  all in all  if you are in the market for a high performance 4 door sports car with a lot of luxury items  the m5 is the perfect car for you  ,bow first found bow always stand motor german engine today bow make line cars

551,auto, i never paid much attention to the mitsubishi eclipse until the new body style came out  when i first saw others driving it  my imagination went to work  it reminded me of a small space ship ripping up and down the highway  i had to have one  however  i put it out of my mind because i was certain that i could not afford it  though i purchased two other cars before i finally settled on the eclipse  i never stopped picturing myself driving it  finally dissatisfied with my last vehicle  i decided to find out if i could afford the mitsubishi eclipse  my faith that there were good affordable cars out there was shaken  i test drove an rs model and it was solid and the ride was smooth  yet it still felt like a sports car  i went into the dealership and haggled over the final price and payments  when i finally decided to lease it for 3 years  well this is my last year in the lease and i m still very satisfied with the car  i have not had any major problems with it at all  the only thing that was irritating was the third break light  there s nothing really supporting it  except for a piece of metal  after having it for two years  it started to bend and it finally broke off  i have discussed this with other eclipse owners and they ve spoken of the same problem  that was really not big deal  because there was also a break light on my spoiler it was also irritating to me to have to get tune ups every 15 000 miles or so  i would recommend this vehicle to someone who wants the sports car feel and look  but not the sports car price  however  i would not recommend the rs model to a die hard sports car fan  you will be disappointed     ,never pay much attention mitsubishi ellipse new body style come first saw others drive imagination go work remind small space ship lipping highway one however put mind certain could afford though purchase two cars finally settle ellipse never stop picture drive finally dissatisfy last vehicle decide find could afford mitsubishi ellipse faith good unfordable cars shake test drive model solid ride smooth yet still felt like sport car go leadership waggle final price payments finally decide lease years well last year lease still satisfy car major problems thing irritate third break light nothing really support except piece metal two years start bend finally break discuss ellipse owners speak problem really big deal also break light spoil also irritate get tune every miles would recommend vehicle someone want sport car feel look sport car price however would recommend model die hard sport car fan disappoint
552,camera, let me start by saying i work for a college  and it with the vast resources of that college i was able to get my hands on this lovely little camera  i have used it extensively for a few months and have a couple of things to say for and against it  we ll start with the bad news  after a short time of being used the menu button  4 position joystick item  stopped functioning correctly  one must try several times when pushing it to the right  that s annoying  but forgivable  the biggest gripe i ve got with this unit is the excessive lag time when you push the button to take the picture  our college also has a lesser sony camera and it does not exhibit this problem  it does indeed make taking action photography impossible  in fact if the subject is moving at all you can bet the picture you get is not the picture you saw when you pushed the button  the next problem i luckily didn t have to deal with  the price of the camera  weighing it at around  1000 on a good day  it s too pricey for most consumers  the disk access time is reasonable  and any drawbacks of having to wait a few extra seconds is more than outweighed by the convenience of using dirt cheap and widely compatible 3 5  disks for media  now let s get started on the good things about this camera  all frills and faults aside  the whole point of a camera is to take good pictures  well with minor adjustment of a few settings this camera takes fantastic pictures at up to 1600x1200dpi resolution  as per the fault of jpgs in general  the pictures do have noticeable artifacts when you zoom in  but at not enough to distract from the overall look of the photo  the program key on the side lets you adjust for different light settings  and has some very helpful presets in it  if you re feeling brave you can adjust the f stop or shutter speed manually via the first two options under the program key  setting the f stop at around 8 and using the flash can produce rich colors and an improved depth of field over the standard method of shooting  one thing to be aware of is that when you do move the f stop to a higher number  it lets less light into the camera  thereby dimming the lcd panel  or viewfinder  considerably  because the camera does not have an optical viewfinder this makes it difficult to frame pictures well with the f stop set to a high number  i rarely find myself using the top mounted viewfinder on the camera as the lcd panel provides a larger and more visible depiction of what the camera is pointed at  a very neat little gadget they thought to build into this camera is a sensor in the viewfinder  the viewfinder is off until you move it close to your eye to look through it  at which point it comes one  very neat  still i wish they would have went for an optical viewfinder  macro and auto focus both work very well for most applications  manually focussing the camera is a little difficult because of the sensitivity of the focus ring on the end of the lens  the steady shot  as it s namesake  keeps the camera from responding to every tiny movement in your hand  creating a steadier picture with less chance of motion blur  the flash on the camera works well for all non macro photos  as i had mentioned before to get a good picture with the flash you would have to set the f stop  anywhere from 4 9 6  which causes your preview image to go dark  for macro shots  the lens gets in the way of the flash  causing a u shaped ring of darkness on the photo  alternative lighting is necessary for such photos  the lens has a 52mm filter thread on the end for attaching any of your favorite optical filters to the camera  the built in filters take care of a lot of problem color issues  and the built in effects can produce some very interesting photos  i m thoroughly in love with the sepia effect on this camera  the camera can take up to 15 second mpeg movies  with real time audio and video  i found that impressive  you can even set the camera to allow you to record an audio track with every picture you take  those features and related ones i haven t had much use for  but it is nice to have them  ,let start say work college vast resources college able get

553,camera, excellent choice for a digital camera  i purchased the olympus d 620l because of the  1  zoom capability and  2  through the lense viewing  have owned the d 620l for about six months  now  using it for news coverage for a weekly newspaper  in all conditions from low light to using alternative flash sources and have found it to be an excellent overall use camera at the time of purchase  the camera was at the high end of non professional cameras at about  900  but understand that the price range has dropped using the  quot super fine quot  mode  1700 pixels  the 16 mb smartcard will hold between 16 and 18 photographs  so if the user needs to photograph more photos in one setting  one must purchase additional smartcards at a price of about  75 each  download directly from the camera to the computer is slow  about 1 minute per photo  however  by using a flashpath adapter in the 3 1 2 quot  computer drive  download time is cut by about one half   smartcard adaptors cost range from about  75 to  100  but well worth it autofocus feature is excellent  though cannot focus in low light conditions or in conditions with little or no contrast viewfinder provides a view of about 95  of picture area  under moderate low light conditions  the camera will expose the photo  but causes blurring when the subject is moving my first digital was a ricoh digital with two zoom settings  portrait and distant  but had only 750 pixel maximum capabilities  i chose the olympus d 620l as a replacement because of the larger format area and through the lens system  one of the very few  quot personal quot  cameras capable of this feature the small built in flash is excellent for short distance photography but is not adequate for a distance beyond about 20 feet  beyond that range  one must use a separate after market flash  but is difficult to get the flash s settings so that one does not either under or over expose  after downloading photographs  however  when using a quality software  i use adobe photoshop  one can readily enhance  crop  modify colors  contrast and sharpness  the camera comes with a software program that has limited capabilities in this area  but is useful if no other photo software program is available the d620l is surprisingly lightweight  camera controls are easy to use  easy to learn and to remember  the small review screen located on the back of the camera provides an excellent review of either the latest picture taken  or preview pictures  however  when using the viewfinder  one is very likely to get facial oils on the small review screen  requiring regular cleaning  i installed a clear plastic cover over the screen to eliminate this factor and to protect the sensitive  easily scratchable screen from damage  the protective screen works well and is removable  using velcro the camera eats up regular alkaline batteries  four  particularly in high mode photography and with flash  i use rechargeable batteries  two sets that are interchangeable to help correct this problem  the camera s setting screen  that gives the photographer information about the various settings of the camera  does provide an accurate display of battery condition so that one can interchange batteries when battery condition become low  the camera will not function when battery condition falls below that required overall  however  i have found the olympus d620l an excellent choice for digital cameras in the medium price range  below  1 000     ,excellent choice digital camera purchase polypus room capability sense view own six months use

555,camera, i wondered why professional online reviewers such as steves digicams and dpreview made no mention of this camera  i think i can tell you why  this is a 5 megapixel camera designed for low end consumers  however  i will tell you that there are things to like as i understand it  the dx4 series is supposed to be higher end consumer  dx4530 means  dx4 higher end  5 megapixels  3 zoom ratio  0 don t know  why make a 5 mpixel camera that has the control you d expect from a 2 mpixel camera pro  the camera is lightweight  230g or 250g with batteries  it uses aa batteries  hooray  it is small  comfortable to hold  easy to use  most unusual is that it has lens threads for addons  msrp is  400 cons  menus are totally dumbed down  which means few options  you d expect more from a 5 megapixel camera  compression  jpeg quality setting  is too high and not settable  a 3 star image is 5 megapixel image with a jpeg quality setting that results in files that are typically 800 kb in size  from most 5 megapixel cameras you would expect file sizes of 2 mb at high quality  no lighting adjustment setting  incandescent  fluorescent  etc  no gimmicks such as panorama assist and color filters  sepia  etc i compared indoor flash and non flash photos to a sony dsc v1  ok  this isn t terribly fair  but i wanted to understand how kodak falls short  the image resolution hardly suffered from the high compression  low quality  jpeg setting  but the colors were noticeably off  too saturated  if you understand jpeg algortihms  this is what you expect   the compression mostly squeezes out chrominance information  so the colors get messed with  but image resolution is largely preserved  i tried to get information from kodak about the jpeg settings that were chosen  thru support i received an uninformative letter that told me all kodak cameras squeeze 5 1  note  this is nonsense  jpeg doesn t allow you to choose compression ratio because it depends on the image contents  also a 5 megapixel image is 15 megabytes of data  so the compression ratio is closer to 15 1  similarly a senior employee in marketing was unable to provide any information beyond sales blather conclusion the pictures were only ok  but since the camera is dumbed down  we ll never know if the hardware might be capable of far better quality  the camera needs to offer far more user settings if you want a 5 mpixel camera that uses aa batteries  highly desirable  you have other choices  see steves digicams com for a summary table if you want a threaded lens adapter  you have very few choices and most others   except for sony dsc v1   are heavy and bulky  ,wonder professional online review stevens digicams review make mention camera think tell megapixel camera design low end consumers however tell things like understand series suppose higher end consumer mean higher end megapixels room ratio know make mix camera control expect mix camera pro camera lightweight batteries use batteries doorway small comfortable hold easy use unusual lens thread add sons venus totally dump mean option expect megapixel camera compression peg quality set high settle star image megapixel image peg quality set result file typically b size megapixel camera would expect file size mb high quality light adjustment set incandescent fluorescent etc gimmicks panorama assist color filter septa etc compare indoor flash non flash photo sonya duc ok terribly fair want understand today fall short image resolution hardly suffer high compression low quality peg set color noticeably saturate understand peg algortihms expect compression mostly squeeze chrominance information color get miss image resolution largely preserve try get information today peg settings choose thou support receive uninformative letter tell today camera squeeze note nonsense peg allow choose compression ratio depend image content also megapixel image megabytes data compression ratio closer similarly senior employee market unable provide information beyond sales lather conclusion picture ok since camera dump never know hardware might capable far better quality camera need offer far user settings want mix camera use batteries highly desirable choice see stevens digicams com summary table want treat lens adapt choice others except sonya duc heavy bulky
556,auto, i purchased a 2003 infinity g35 sports sedan about 10 weeks ago  it s silver  with a black leather interior  moonroof  sports suspension package and bose stereo  i wrote my first review  just days after taking delivery  and in retrospect  i feel i didn t do the car the justice it deserves  after spending more time behind the wheel  i now believe i can give a fair  accurate report  much of my initial impressions are still valid  the car has incredible power  awesome handling and spectacular brakes  the seats are really comfortable and the car looks just great  but one of the nicest things about the car is the sound  the engine has the warmest purr at low speeds  not too loud  not too soft  and a tremendous roar when you nail it  i really enjoy just putting down the windows  opening the moonroof and just cruising  however  in my initial review  i felt the sports package made the ride too firm  but in hindsight  i believe it s just right  my former car had a much softer suspension and i when i first began driving the g35  i wasn t used to the ride  after several weeks  the car s ride now feels fine  it is firm  but nicely so  and not too jarring  i was also not too kind to the bose stereo  but with some adjusting  i was able to get a really clear  crisp sound  you just have to crank it up  i still have some small gripes though  the ergonomics of the stereo and climate control systems are just plain confusing and difficult to adjust while you re driving  and one aspect of the car s operation is  in my opinion  somewhat dangerous  when you start the car  the dash lights up automatically  during the day  no problem  but at night  it gives you the impression that your headlights are on when they aren t   with every car i ve ever driven  the dash lights come on when you turn on your headlights  the first time this happened to me i was pulling out of a parking lot at night and just about got nailed  it s really something infinity should look into  all in all though  the g35 is a great car  great looks  great performance and a great price  there s nothing wrong with that  ,purchase infinity sport sedan weeks ago silver black leather interior moorhof sport suspension package bone sterno write first review days take delivery introspect feel car justice deserve spend time behind wheel believe give fair accurate report much initial impressions still valid car incredible power awesome handle spectacular rake seat really comfortable car look great one nicest things car sound engine warmest pure low speed loud soft tremendous roar nail really enjoy put windows open moorhof bruise however initial review felt sport package make ride firm insight believe right former car much softer suspension first begin drive use ride several weeks car ride feel fine firm nicely jar also kind bone sterno adjust able get really clear crisp sound crank still small grapes though economics sterno climate control systems plain confuse difficult adjust drive one aspect car operation opinion somewhat dangerous start car dash light automatically day problem night give impression headlights every car ever drive dash light come turn headlights first time happen pull park lot night get fail really something infinity look though great car great look great performance great price nothing wrong
557,camera, my office just purchased one of these cameras last week and we still haven t gotten finished oohing and ahhing over it  it is so chock full of features that we have yet to use them all  and we play i mean work with this thing daily like most sony digital cameras  it features an lcd screen on the back of the camera  this is used to preview the pictures you shoot  it also has a viewfinder that is only one when you put your eye up to it  so it actually detects that you are looking through it  how cool is that  also standard to sony digitals is the built in diskette drive for storing the photos and video  in addition to standard floppies  you can buy an adapter that fits into the floppy drive and allows you to use memory sticks for storing even more pictures and video the average 640x480 picture taken by this camera is about 37k and looks great  the 1600x1280 pics are roughly 350k and look perfect  this is an excellent camera for taking and printing pictures on photo quality paper and framing  it s 2 1 megapixels  and you need at least 2 0 megapixels to properly print 8 5x11 size paper pictures  this gives you just a little extra for your money it s a little heavy  and not really a small camera  so you wouldn t want to lug this thing around a theme park all day  then again  maybe you would just because you d get the respect of other techies and photographers in the park the sony digimavica fd 95 is very easy to use and takes excellent quality pictures  i recommend you buy the diskette adapter and memory sticks in order to store more and larger pictures br br  ,office purchase one camera last week still get finish ooze ache clock full feature yet use play mean work thing daily like sonya digital camera feature lead screen back camera use review picture shoot also viewfinder one put eye actually defect look cool also standard sonya digital build diskette drive store photo video addition standard flop buy adapt fit floppy drive allow use memory stick store even picture video average picture take camera look great pick roughly look perfect excellent camera take print picture photo quality paper frame megapixels need least megapixels properly print size paper picture give little extra money little heavy really small camera want leg thing around theme park day maybe would get respect echo photographer park sonya digimavica ff easy use take excellent quality picture recommend buy diskette adapt memory stick order store larger picture br
558,camera, i received this camera as a birthday present back in february  i have used it constantly since  i have three kids  ages 4  2 and 10 months  so everyone is always wanting pictures  i chose this camera mainly because of the 4 2 mp  and the size of it  i also liked it because it is an hp and so is our computer and printer  the picture quality is wonderful  even when the kids are moving   which mine constantly are  the color is great  even in low light  the only thing i wasn t 100  happy about is the small disk it came with  when we went to the fair i used up my 13 pictures within the first hour   it can vary from 11 to 14 pictures on the disk  depending on the memory each picture takes  so i ended up having to borrow someone else s camera to take the rest of the pictures because i wasn t willing to delete any  now i am a picture aholic  so some people may not have this problem  but i went and got another disk with a larger capacity  some people complain about the batteries in this camera  i have had it for almost six months and changed the batteries twice  i average about 5 7 pictures a day  including the self timer and video feature which use more battery life  so i d say the batteries last quite awhile  i use the lithium batteries  and defiently recomend them  they aren t that much more expensive in my opinion  i didn t get the docking port  because since we have an hp computer all i have to do is plug it in and it automatically uploads the pictures that i took  i also saw some complaints about delay  the only time i have had that problem is when i accidently had it on the timer feature  otherwise the pics snapped almost instantly  my son dropped this camera on the floor  which is industrial tile  from his level  about counter top height  and the only problem we had was a slight scuff spot on it  all features still work with no damage  this is the best digital camera i have used so far  ,receive camera birthday present back february use constantly since three kiss age months everyone always want picture choose camera mainly size also like computer printer picture quality wonderful even kiss move mine constantly color great even low light thing happy small disk come go fair use picture within first hour vary picture disk depend memory picture take end borrow someone else camera take rest picture will delete picture catholic people may problem go get another disk larger capacity people complain batteries camera almost six months change batteries twice average picture day include self time video feature use battery life say batteries last quite awhile use lithium batteries defiantly recommend much expensive opinion get lock port since computer plug automatically uplands picture take also saw complaints delay time problem accidently time feature otherwise pick snap almost instantly son drop camera floor industrial tile level counter top height problem slight stuff spot feature still work damage best digital camera use far
559,camera, i ve been dying for a digital camera for years  and an online friend picked up a little  50 vivitar at wal mart that took awesome pics  i researched it online  and while doing so the vivitar 3615 caught my eye  my husband and i decided that we should  splurge  and get the more expensive model  we haven t regretted it since  it takes very clear pics in either high or low resolution mode  although i can t really tell the difference  in low res mode you will be able to take more pics before uploading them  the manual says it can hold around 86 pics  but when we took pics of the fireworks on july 4  i had over 130 in the camera  and that s without any additional storage card  pictures upload quickly  and you have the option of selecting changing your file for uploading to  you can also have the computer delete the pics from the camera once they re uploaded  the lcd viewscreen is very clear  the only problem i have with it is that it gets in the way of my nose when i m trying to use the viewfinder  so i end up either cleaning the screen after each picture or holding my head at an awkward angle while i m taking pictures the batteries don t seem to last too long  but being rechargeables i expected that  i invested in an additional set of batteries and a rapid charger  total cost   30  so i always have a fully charged set on hand  plus a pack of alkalines in case of emergency  once in a while  if the camera is jarred too hard the batteries will shift and cause the camera s time date settings to reset  i also get the occasional blurry pic  but that s user error  not camera defect the flash works very well  almost too well in many conditions  i was playing with my 6 yo daughter  and took a picture of her in a completely dark room  the flash made it appear that she was in a well lit room  often i get pics where my subject  usually my cats  are washed out because it s too bright  but i get enough good quality pics that i can overlook the few bad ones overall  i would highly recommend this camera  whether you re a first time digital buyer or on a budget  i do plan on getting a different one in the future  hopefully with video camera mode  but i assure you  i will not get rid of this one  i have already saved hundreds of dollars on film  this camera pays for itself in a short period of time  it s wonderful  ,die digital camera years online friend pick little visitor mary take awesome pick research online visitor catch eye husband decide plunge get expensive model regret since take clear pick either high low resolution mode although really tell difference low yes mode able take pick unload manual say hold around pick take pick fireworks july camera without additional storage card picture unload quickly option select change file unload also computer delete pick camera unload lead viewscreen clear problem get way nose try use viewfinder end either clean screen picture hold head awkward angle take picture batteries seem last long rechargeables expect invest additional set batteries rapid charge total cost always fully charge set hand plus pack alkaline case emergency camera bar hard batteries shift cause camera time date settings rest also get occasional flurry pick user error camera defect flash work well almost well many condition play daughter take picture completely dark room flash make appear well light room often get pick subject usually cat wash bright get enough good quality pick overlook bad ones overall would highly recommend camera whether first time digital buyer budget plan get different one future hopefully video camera mode assure get rid one already save hundreds dollars film camera pay short period time wonderful

563,camera, i got the pdr m5 as a christmas gift from my husband  i had wanted a digital camera for my birthday in october  but we just couldn t decide on which one to get when we were shopping for one  he went out shopping by himself after that and talked to many people  finally deciding on this camera  i think if you are in the market for a digital camera  it is definitely worth your money to get as many pixels as possible  the lower end cameras are just not worth it  this camera has many great features  i love the pop up flash  the zoom  wide angle  macro  etc  it takes pictures that are very sharp  the first pictures that i emailed to a group of friends came back with many comments about how clear the picture was  and comments such as wow i wish my camera took pictures like that i also like the fact that you can take shots in different resolutions  depending on how high a quality you need the picture to be  and also how many pictures you need to fit on your media card  the camera tells you how many pictures you can still fit on the card  at each of the resolutions it s very easy to get the pictures to your computer  just install the software that comes with the camera  and hook up by usb or serial port to download them another great feature is that it comes with a video out jack and cord that you can plug right into your tv to see the pictures  we have a 61 quot  big screen tv  and when putting the pictures on the tv  we expected to loose some of the sharpness  blowing them up so big  but they were amazingly clear  sharp  and clean  one way i think we ll use this feature is to keep all of our vacation pictures on a separate media card  and look at them as a slide show on the tv  this camera will also take video clips  but does not record sound as other cameras do  you can add sound later if you download them using the software  and recording an audio clip through your computer to go with the picture even though we ve had this camera only a short time  i know already it was a good choice  when using it at the family christmas gatherings  i could tell everyone was pretty impressed with it another great use for a digital camera is if you sell items on ebay or other auction sites  taking a picture with a digital camera  downloading it into your computer  and then deleting it off the media card  saves lots of money compared to buying film  developing film  having to scan the photos  and then throwing them away after the item sells  that is a waste of money i plan to do a lot more selling on ebay now that i have a digital camera br br  ,get per christmas gift husband want digital camera birthday october decide one get shop one go shop talk many people finally decide camera think market digital camera definitely worth money get many pip possible lower end camera worth camera many great feature love pop flash room wide angle micro etc take picture sharp first picture remain group friends come back many comment clear picture comment wish camera take picture like also like fact take shots different resolutions depend high quality need picture also many picture need fit media card camera tell many picture still fit card resolutions easy get picture computer install software come camera hook us aerial port download another great feature come video jack cord plug right see picture quit big screen put picture expect loose sharpness blow big amazingly clear sharp clean one way think use feature keep vacation picture separate media card look slide show camera also take video clip record sound camera add sound later download use software record audit clip computer go picture even though camera short time know already good choice use family christmas gather could tell everyone pretty impress another great use digital camera sell items bay auction sit take picture digital camera download computer meet media card save lot money compare buy film develop film scan photo throw away item cells waste money plan lot sell bay digital camera br
564,auto, three weeks ago  i bought a 2000 acura 3 2tl  though the 92 octane gas gets to be a little expensive  the mileage on this car is so great  that i hardly notice  i got the one with the gps built in  and i never get lost  i crack up whenever i hear it say  quot quick turn ahead quot  because the programming on the voice is such that it does not manage to say it perfectly the car handles wonderfully  the acceleration is so smooth that i got to 80  and without looking at my speedometer  thought i was going too slow on the highway  the suspension is good enough that when the road surface gets rough  you can barely feel it  the anti lock brakes are so good you can stop on a dime  the car is aerodynamic  and there is very little wind noise when you drive  the sportshift  a  quot manual override quot  for the automatic transmission  is wonderfully smooth  and almost gives you the same feel that you have with manual transmission  however  you almost never use it because the normal automatic transmission is so smooth that it is hard to feel the difference in short  this is a wonderful car  for anyone willing to spend the  30 000 dollars to buy it  and the only problem with it  is that you love it so much  if it gets dinged  you break into a crying fit  about the poor car  that with the purr of the engine  seems to be as alive as your family cat br br  ,three weeks ago buy acute though ocean gas get little expensive mileage car great hardly notice get one gas build never get lose crack whenever hear say quit quick turn ahead quit program voice manage say perfectly car candle wonderfully acceleration smooth get without look speedometer think go slow highway suspension good enough road surface get rough barely feel anti lock rake good stop time car aerodynamic little wind noise drive sportshift quit manual overrule quit automatic transmission wonderfully smooth almost give feel manual transmission however almost never use normal automatic transmission smooth hard feel difference short wonderful car anyone will spend dollars buy problem love much get din break cry fit poor car pure engine seem alive family cat br

566,camera, i have owned the 2600 for a little over a year now and overall it has been a pretty decent camera  my usual disclaimer  manufacturers spend lots of money on their own websites where you can pick up the technical specs of cameras  i just want to give you my opinion on the camera not be redundant with information you can easily pick up elsewhere overall the image quality will look good to the majority of people  i have printed out up to 8x10 size using photo glossy paper on an epson photo ex that looks very good  not as good as a 35mm 8x10  but still very good for a 2meg digital  unless you are real camera buff or picky picky picky you should be pleased with the image quality you will receive  maybe it is just me  but the printed quality looks better than the digital image i see on my computer screens 133strange  a kodak dc 260 that i used to shoot with seemed to have better screen image quality when viewed on a monitor than the 2600 the view screen on the back has adjustable brightness  but as with many such screens it is difficult to see in very bright sun conditions  it can also be difficult to tell if a picture is blurred unless you use the zoom feature to look closer at the picture  i personally find myself using the viewfinder more than the screen when taking the actual shots ergonomically the 2600 is not bad  it is small  fairly lightweight and i like the sliding cover that helps protect the lenses mechanism  when i hold the camera ready to shoot my fingers falls naturally away from the lenses  flash or any other area that might interfere with normal camera operation  this can be important when you are having a person unfamiliar with the camera take a shot for you  think about the times you have had to tell someone 133 148watch where your fingers are placed 148 as they were trying to take a picture of you  there are not an overwhelming number of buttons to deal with when taking or viewing pictures  the zoom is only a 3x  but it is a true 3x and not a silly digital zoom  one note about the zoom  it will not zoom in or out while the flash is recharging  taking pictures themselves is pretty much point and shoot mode  which is good for those not familiar with the camera  the 2600 is not especially quick in taking a picture when a flash is needed  taking up to 5 seconds between shots depending on the distance of the previous shot  that 146s right  i said the distance of the previous shot  give this a try 133take a flash picture of something across the room 133now take a flash picture of your hand 133notice that the flash will be ready much faster after taking the picture of your hand strange  i am no expert  but i suspect it is using less flash power for the closer picture  thus the faster recharge time  one thing you need to watch is the fact that in auto flash mode the camera will take a picture whether the flash is ready or not  in forced flash mode the camera will not take a picture until the flash is ready  you really need to hold the camera steady for a split second longer to make sure the camera has taken a steady shot  i would say that approximately one picture out of thirty or so is unexpectedly blurred if you are not careful  i usually have anyone taking pictures for me take an extra shot just to be safe  the fact that you can take around 150 shots on a 128meg smart media chip at highest quality makes that possible  the 16meg chip only takes approx 20 shots so i personally would recommend purchasing a larger chip  i have seen come people use the lower resolution modes to get more pictures on a 16meg chip  but why the heck pay for a 2megapixel camera and use the 1megapixel mode all the time the rechargeable 1700mah ni mh batteries will last for hundreds of shots per charge depending on the condition of the batteries  how the flash  view screen and zoom are used and whether you are using the power saver mode  also  there is no battery power gauge other than the one that tells you when the battery is low  i would definitely recommend a second set of batteries since you need to wait until the ni mh batteries are discharged before recharging the video mode quality is low so you probably won 146t use it unless it is the only option  i have used the video mode one time when i only had my 2600 because of space considerations and saw something that was too good to pass up  so it can come in handy the batteries and smart media chip share the same compartment  which is only slightly annoying when changing the memory chip on the move since the door itself only holds the batteries in the software used to connect the camera to the computer is pretty easy to operate and compares well with similar units  a word about the toughness of the camera  i used the camera for approximately a year in a harsh desert environment with only one problem near the end of that year  one single grain of sand made its way into the very inner lenses  this caused a small dark spot on pictures that were focused away  such as scenery shots  considering what i put the camera through it was not too unexpected to have that happen  other than that the camera has performed well  ,own little year overall pretty decent camera usual disclaimer manufacturers spend lot money webster pick technical speck camera want give opinion camera redundant information easily pick elsewhere overall

568,auto, i have driven two different 2002 subaru foresters in the past year because my first one saved my life   how it all started  it all started a year ago when i was graduated college  i was looking to get a new car to commute to work  i had a 1990 honda civic wagon that i liked because it had lots of room and got good miles per gallon  36  i was originally favored getting another honda civic because i would be traveling 50 miles to work everyday and i could save gas  however  being engaged to a woman who loved me very much  and didn t want anything to happen to me  i decided to look at safer cars  the forester really was head and shoulders above anything else i had seen  the price was low  22 000  the gas mileage was good for a car like that  26 mpg hwy  and it was safe  more on that later  in addition  it had all wheel drive  perfect for those new england winters  the dealership  tristate subaru in webster  mass  sealed the deal with their kindness and informed staff   initial impressions  the car was roomy  it s not as luxurious as a volvo  but it really is comfortable  i noticed that the engine is silent especially when idle  this is really nice for sleeping children  the car has some pickup  as you will find out later  came in real handy  and it will seem jerky at first  the driving is smooth and stable  you can feel the car s weight shift if you take a corner hard  but never do i feel the car is going to tip  the cargo space it ok  not as much as a volvo  but certainly noteworthy  my only complaint in this phase was it corners wider than most cars i m used to  the honda wagon i had cornered real tight  and even my mom s volvo wagon turned tighter  i m not too good at lining up parking spaces  because i took my tight turning radius for granted   the accident  this is the event that ensured that i will buy subarus until they go out of business or until they go down in quality  a fully loaded septic truck with two porta potties on the back hit me driver s side while i was pulling into my driveway  the truck driver  i estimate  was going between 25 30 mph  although i have been told that there s a good chance it could have been faster  when he hit me  i was waiting for oncoming traffic to clear while making a left turn into my driveway  when the last car cleared  i noticed out of my rear view mirror that the truck coming down the hill behind me wasn t going to be able to stop  i had already committed to the turn  so i decided to  gun it  into the driveway before he could hit me  well  the truck driver swerved into the oncoming lane in order to avoid hitting me in the back  just as i was gunning it into the driveway and hit me driver s side in the rear door  he would have hit me on my door if the car didn t have the pickup it did  you can see the damage from these pics http webpages charter net defensor aug28 08 jpg http webpages charter net defensor aug28 09 jpg here are the pics from the scene to show just how far the truck dragged the car sideways http webpages charter net defensor aug28 05 jpg http webpages charter net defensor aug28 06 jpg http webpages charter net defensor aug28 07 jpg to make a long story short  this is what i learned about my car from this accident  it was strong  that truck was going fast and hit me straight on  i had a little neck stiffness from the initial impact  but the car surprisingly absorbed that really well  besides that i had a bruise on my side  you see the damage to the car and it s mind boggling  i wish i would have taken a picture of the inside because besides a little broken glass  someone could have easily survived if they were sitting in the rear driver s side seat  the car was totaled  but i was alive  the other thing was i learned that the pickup in the car is there if you need it  i might have had more bruises if the truck had actually hit me on my door  i obviously got another 2002 subaru forester to replace this one  the depreciation was only  2 000 after piling on 10 000 miles in just over 3 months   other stuff i missed  this car is good in snow  real fun to drive in snow  it has held up well so far even though i only have 22 000 on my second  so i don t know how it will drive after 100 000 miles b overall verdict  if you like sports cars and weaving in and out of traffic and impressing women  you probably won t like this car  if you have kids and a family  or just want to be able to survive an accident  buy this car  i can t stress this enough  i m not a rich guy  but this is the best  most reliable car i have ever driven  i can t imagine buying any other car  if you want hard info about the car  i suggest visiting a site like edmunds com because i don t have that info readily available  i go back to the dealership for services and whatnot every month or so  and the dealers there have told me that the printout from my accident photos have sold them dozens of foresters  i m happy about that  ,drive two different sugar

570,auto, i purchased this truck in november of 1998  when searching for a new 4 wheel drive quality and price were the first considerations but comfort was also very important  not only does this truck have a haul tow option that improves engine performance but it rides like a luxury sedan  the ergonomic adjustment in both front seats gives total back support and comfort for those long drives  the drivers ability to reach all controls with ease and the added options of extra ac dc outlets allows adding a laptop and cell phone and a charger or numerous other devices that can be used all at the same time  with all the power you can ask for from the vortex engine and excellent gas mileage driving this truck for the last year has been a pleasure  i also think the third door makes shopping so much earier and the rear seat is incredibly roomy br br  ,purchase truck november search new wheel drive quality price first considerations comfort also important truck haul tow option improve engine performance rid like luxury sedan economic adjustment front seat give total back support comfort long drive drivers ability reach control ease add option extra ac outlets allow add lawton cell phone charge numerous devices use time power ask vortex engine excellent gas mileage drive truck last year pleasure also think third door make shop much earlier rear seat incredibly room br

572,auto, my experience i test drove a saturn ion 2 5 speed sedan at a local dealership  my test drive lasted over half an hour  and covered city streets  winding secondary roads  and the freeway  performance a theme which you ll quickly notice developing in this review is that saturn got all the big stuff right with the ion  but tends to hiccup on the details  for example  the engine  the ion s 2 2 liter four cylinder is torquey and robust feeling  and it provided plenty of low end grunt for effortless around town acceleration on my test drive  when i wound up the engine on a freeway on ramp  it provided healthy midrange response and pulled the car up to speed with ease  but eager it s not there s something about this engine that makes the revs climb and fall with sloth like lethargy  as if the flywheel was two sizes too big  the power is there  but the engine doesn t zing to the redline like those in the honda civic and mazda 3  transmission clutch the ion s transmission was also a mixed bag  on one hand  i loved the shifter  its throws were short  and its gates well defined  so the lever thunked from gear to gear with reassuring solidity and precision  but the clutch was a bit disappointing  it has a short throw  which should make it feel sporty  but its vague take up makes it difficult to change gears smoothly  as much as i liked the transmission s shift action  the jerky starts resulting from the tricky clutch take up were a bit embarrassing  maybe it would get easier with familiarity  something i admittedly had little opportunity to build on my half hour test drive  steering handling this is the area where the ion s  big stuff right  little stuff wrong  dichotomy reaches its peak  good news first  the ion s chassis is a solid and capable handler  its suspension kept body lean well controlled in tight corners  and the tires provided plenty of grip on twisty roads  driven hard  the ion felt more surefooted and confident than most of its economy car rivals  but the bad news is that the ion s steering is among the worst i ve experienced in a new car  it s an electrically assisted system  as opposed to the hydraulic systems in most cars  and the software needs some rethinking to give it the natural feeling response of more conventional setups  its weighting is feather light  and its ratio is extremely quick meaning that it takes very little effort or movement to turn the wheels  this is great for one finger parking  but the system is also more than a little vague around the straight ahead position  making the ion feel touchy and nervous on the road  on the freeway  the steering required what i consider more than acceptable concentration to avoid zig zagging in my lane  i ll admit that i m a stickler for steering feel  so this flaw may not seem as glaring to most drivers as it did to me  but if i were actually in the market for another new car  the ion s misguided steering would have been enough to prevent me from purchasing it  the silver lining here is that  since the system is electric and not hydraulic  it will be far easier for saturn to reprogram it and make improvements to it in the near future  ride here s one aspect of the ion that is unquestionably positive  the ion had an excellent ride  with a suspension that managed to smother bumps effectively while maintaining good control of body motions  there was a bit more floating over dips and rises than you d find in a honda civic  but it never became uncomfortably bouncy  and most buyers will appreciate the added softness  road and wind noise were kept to a minimum  which gave the ion a very quiet freeway ride  the engine became a bit vocal when i revved it hard  but under normal circumstances it was pleasantly muted  these solid  quiet ride characteristics gave the ion a  big car  feel that lent it a sense of quality  interior the automotive press has griped at length about the ion s youthful  forward looking cabin  but i had no such complaints  in fact  i liked the ion s interior more than those of most other cars in its class  where most economy cars strive for a simple  familiar interior design that is unlikely to offend anyone s aesthetic sensibilities  the ion surrounds its driver in funky  modern styling that may have less mass appeal  but is considerably more interesting  the ion s dashboard is molded in warm sand dune colors  and it was covered in unusual dimpled textures that were pleasing to my gen y aethetic sense  the plastics felt hard and a bit cheap in places  but there was nothing egregious in evidence  the ion s gauge pod is mounted in the center of the dashboard  instead of directly in front of the driver  and while some people dislike this feature  i appreciated the wide open  unobstructed view forward that the relocated gauges provide  there were only two weak points in the ion s interior  one is the seats  which were far from uncomfortable  but felt a bit short on padding and support  the other was the thoroughly aggravating shift light  which illuminated in bright orange every time i exceeded 2500 rpms  driving that way helps save gas  which i m all for  but sometimes acceleration is nice too like when you re merging with freeway traffic  if i want to be told when to shift  i ll drive an automatic  ok    practicality the ion meets or surpasses its competition in this area  as well  the interior felt roomy and provided plenty of space for passengers  the rear seat  in particular  seemed uncommonly spacious for an economy sedan  the trunk also provided unexpected capacity  and standard split folding rear seats allow you to expand the cargo area for bulkier loads  one other feature i appreciated was the height adjustable driver s seat  which is standard on the ion 2 trim level  reliability consumer reports rates the ion s reliability above average  and did the same for its predecessor  the s series  saturn s small cars seem to be pretty trouble free machines  so you re not likely to get into trouble here  overall despite the negativity of much of my review  i really wanted to love the saturn  and give it my whole hearted recommendation  the simple reason was that the customer service at the saturn dealership was hands down the best i have ever experienced  being a car obsessed college student  i go to a whole lot of dealerships to drive new cars  and put up with the same shtick at each and every one  a salesperson accosts me within seconds of arriving on the lot  rushes me through a test drive  and upon returning to the dealership  sends me into the manager s lair for a more thorough interrogation  these have been the tactics at nearly every dealership i ve been to except saturn s  at the saturn dealer  what i found was a lot full of unlocked cars  without a single prowling salesperson to be found  i poked around the interior of the car i drove for at least fifteen minutes  with no harassment  when i was just about to start looking for a salesperson can you imagine someone walked up and asked if i needed any help  when i asked for a test drive  he said   a test drive  sure  here s the key  take your time  just call if you re going to be more than a half hour  oh  and while you re out  try to take some city streets and some freeways  too  so you really get a feel for how it drives  i was stunned  and i certainly had plenty of time to get a feel for the way the ion drives  although the unfortunate answer is  not spectacularly  the onslaught of aggravations from the steering and drivetrain dooms the ion to automotive mediocrity in my view  despite its strengths in other areas  so it comes down to this  what s more important to you  the driving experience or the buying experience  if your biggest concern is avoiding pushy and confrontational salespeople  saturn is the way to go  if you re more concerned with the car itself  you may want to keep looking  ,experience test drive return ion speed sedan local leadership test

576,camera, after my canon powershot 300 died in a puddle in the bilge of a sailboat  i went in to the local camera ship to replace it  i was looking for something similar  a compact point and shoot digital camera  i figured i d upgrade to 4 megapixels  which is no problem since most of the newer compact cameras offer this level of resolution  i did have a look at the new pentax optio s  known as the camera that  fits in an altoids tin  but  frankly  it s just too small  i was looking at the new canon powershot 400  telling the story of how the last one died  and the sales guy showed me the olympus  i have been very happy with the canon  and they have a reputation for excellent image quality  so i was a bit reluctant to try a different make  but after he showed me the water  and dust resistant seals on all the openings  ports  battery  etc  on the olympus  i was sold  i travel quite a bit  and the fact that stray dust  sand  salt  and water won t get into the innards of the camera is very attractive  of course  this is not a waterproof camera  you cannot immerse it  for that you need a waterproof housing  but i don t know of any other manufacturer that has put this sort of attention into their stock compact camera housings  water  and dust  resistant design  all the openings have rubber gaskets so that the camera won t die if splashed or dropped in a puddle  the gaskets also prevent sand and dust from getting into the innards  design  very sexy  and certainly small and light enough  i checked out the new pentax optio s  which is known as the camera that fits in an altoids tin   the thing is just too small  unless you have very small hands  i would love a camera that light  4 ounces instead of  8 ounces for the olympus  but not quite that small  unless they can make the controls a bit larger  user interface  relatively easy to figure out  quick to navigate  and the features don t get lost in the shuffle  i did a quick read of the manual  and now i remember  and use  many of the features regularly  and this is after only 10 days  usb drivers  the camera s usb interface is set up so that the camera appears to the computer just like a removable drive  so it doesn t require any special software to copy images from the camera to the pc  4 megapixel resolution  both shq  super high quality  and hq  high quality  images end up at 2272x1704 pixels  hq eat about 1mb each  shq s about 2 5mb each  this means that my 128mb xd card will hold about 128 hq pics or about 50 shq s  night shooting mode  permits exposures up to 4 seconds  in combination with the self timer or remote control  and possibly a tiny little portable tripod  you can do some fun stuff at night with this camera  remote control  comes with the camera  allowing remote shutter release  of course  you can just use the self timer  but the remote is a nice touch    picture quality  seems quite good  although i have not printed anything yet    xd memory card format  why another new format  xd is only a little smaller than sd  xd s backers say that it s faster and the spec can handle larger capacities than sd  but i doubt there s actually any difference    battery life  seems fine  i ll update the review once i have more detail  as usual  there is no detailed battery level indicator    the battery charger has a cord  if you re familiar with the canon cameras  their battery chargers simply plug directly into the wall socket  without a cord  saving a bit of space and tangle in your travel bag  if you need a cord  you can always use an extension  a small point  but i prefer no cord    no audio or voice recording function  would be nice  ,canon powershot die puddle bile sailboat go local camera ship replace look something similar compact point shoot digital camera

there are many advantages that come with this camera  first of all  the batteries are rechargeable  this means you won t have to continually buy new batteries for your camera  second of all  it s  very  easy to use  the commands are obvious and simple to get used to  and the buttons on the camera are easy to maneuver i also like the fact it runs on compact flash memory  prices are dropping everyday on these cards  which  by the way  are easy to remove and replace in your camera  the camera comes with a 16mb card which held 50 high quality pics  and i bought a 128mb viking card for  70   which holds over 500 pics possibly most importantly  i am appreciative of the fact of the customer service and the one year warranty that came with this camera  i got this for a gift for my birthday and didn t even have a receipt for it  after having trouble with my model freezing up  i called customer service and after i spoke with a few people  they sent me a brand new camera with postage to send the broken one back  i was very happy with their care  especially considering i didn t have a proof of purchase  the new camera has been working beautifully  i think i just initially got a lemon  i was thrilled customer service was so helpful and offered to replace the camera  especially since this camera is no longer being made b disadvantages  well  there are also some not so great things about this camera  the rechargeable batteries do run out quickly if you use the lcd often  i have 2 sets of batteries  so this usually isn t a problem for me  picked a spare pack up at radio shak for like  15  the camera itself is a little large  but it fits well in my camera case from my older minolta camera  i also found that hooking it up to a windows 2000 machine wasn t too easy  as it didn t like the usb  i got around this by buying a compact flash reader  which just stays plugged in all the time into my pc  then  when i remove my card from my camera and put it in my reader  its like a little separate hard drive with all of my pictures on it  very easy and convenient b conclusion b i love this camera  it s easy to use   takes wonderful clear pictures  i am glad that hp stands behind

578,camera, this is an unwieldy  jerk  amongst today s it cameras  powerful  yes  capable  yes  slow  yes  most of all you will notice the quirky  look  and downright wierd design shell in particular the placements of controls  yes  all of sony s ergonomic specialist must have been away on holiday during this development  for example  i can t get my finger to the  joystick  control when i hold it to my eye because my nose rests smack on it  i have actually managed to access the menus using my  beak  instead  this is a  hidden feature   the sony  beak controlled menu  at least sony has not yet advertised it as   sniff out all sony s new babble babble more examples  the auto manual focus button that i often use is identical and next to the steady shot on off that i seldom change  thanks to my trusty dremel 20 000 rpm drill they are no longer confusable to my  finger spits the shutter button is recessed and therefore hard to find in a hurry  a nice little  blob  of self curing adhesive acrylic fixed that for good  also severe problems with the  manual  exposure controls that i can only find if i can see them   so forget adjusting exposure manually with the camera to your eye  unfortunately these controls are just too tiny to fix with drill or acrylic  blob  the three pod screw is laughable so use the camera handheld however  i a very happy that i can use 2 3 disks  simultaneously  for different types of pictures like work  sport and family  it takes no time to change disks as required  and no need to fill one disk before you change as with film  only hasselblad offer this with it s  famous  replaceable film cassettes  however  the properties like exposure does of course not change as with different film speeds the fact the cd is not rewritable compatible does not worry me one bit as long as  crook  pictures can be deleted  with lost disk space  at the low low cost of each 8cm cd disks  and no need to muck around with cables and software  just pop the disk in the computer drive and enjoy a full screen of image pleasure  here on the computer is were i do the picture adjustments and size cropping  the camera provides the option of  digital zoom  for the many silly  jerks  amongst its users  there is no such thing as a  digital zoom  really  it s actually an  in camera frame cropping  that may just save a bit of cheap disk space  why would you pay good money for a hi res pickup of 2 3 million pixels and then only use a 30  in the middle with this silly  zoomey  camera cropping  only jerks use the digital zoom option and it s a shame its there on a camera with such good optics like on this sony product  forgetaboutit next model needs bigger controls logically arranged and a non slip ergonomic rubber ring around the lens  also a standard flash shoe for  standard  photoflashes and or a ring flash would be really wonderful  yes  the inbuilt pop up flash can best be described as a practical joke if you use it for any macro situation  ha ha ha  very funny  you sony people really know to enjoy the japanese brand of humor  guess i m lucky to be spared the surprice cockroaches this camera sets a bewildering  world record  for poorly executed human design in conjunction with a really good brand new revolutionary concept  i bet a german or dutch brand would not commit such careless sloppy  crime  or  ,unwieldy jerk amongst today

584,camera,  a note to the reader  it 146s been over a year since i 146ve last written a genuine review  and i undoubtedly feel odd as my fingers begin to move over the keyboard again  the way they used to  as stephen king would say  i too  have been accused of  147diarrhea of the word processor 148  and this piece is embarrassingly long  i 146ve tried to give this review a very personal touch  which i trust you will enjoy  miniature reviews of three other cameras are added to depict the progress of my research where applicable  links to sample photos in my photo gallery are provided  i recommend using a separate browser to access these links  and to read the review at the same time  all the photos are very large  but load relatively quickly  even on slow connections  if the links do not work  i would be grateful if you informed me of the problem in your comment  if  on the other hand  geocities protests and says i 146ve exceeded my bandwidth limit  then please bookmark this review and visit the links approximately 1 hour later 133if this has happened  i apologize i b a bit of history  the month of september 2002 could have been described as a month of change 133the month when i began collecting old bottles 133collecting cacti and succulents 133and it was also the month during which i literally grew up in a day  initially  i had little interest in cars  and even less interest in learning how to drive  but that tiny spark turned into a warm fire overnight  and i fell in love with a  jaguar xj6  133an elegant car with a leaping cat ornament adorning its bonnet  a photo of this mascot would grace my profile today  if geocities actually got its act together my interest in digital cameras however  dates back as far as the beginning of the year 2000  at this time  i was intrigued by the little metal boxes my friends carried around  costing over a thousand bucks apiece  the devices produced excellent photos  had nifty controls  and allowed the user to instantly delete mediocre photos to save on memory space  this was something that i had never seen before in a film camera  but the sheer cost of these beasts made me stick to my simple  point and shoot  konica u mini  that was actually a free gift from an unknown package but it was soon clear that i had missed out on many prospective photos  solely because i had taken little pride in my photography  and never had a decent camera with me when i needed it most  interested to form a portfolio  of animal ailments and parasites  among other things  on my computer  a search for that  147perfect 148 camera ensued 133 b glossary of technical jargon 133for your morbid pleasure  it is a pain to listen to a photography freak  especially if one does not understand some basic terms  learning these may help you put these fanatics in their place  together with the false wine  147experts 148  who know much less about wine than themselves  a sales representative may fare better than me  but i thought to include a small list here for the sake of convenience b ccd   an abbreviation for charge coupled device  a sensor that separates the colors of the scene into red  green and blue  allowing the camera to process it  after the ccd captures the black and white image  this is passed through red  green and blue filters to produce color images b iso   an abbreviation for international standardization organization  it refers to the relative sensitivity of film to light  a higher iso depicts a faster film that is more sensitive to light  digital cameras do not have film  per se   but these iso ratings are still used in an identical fashion for the sake of ease  while a higher iso setting allows the capture of images under lower light conditions  it increases the amount of grain or noise  sample taken at iso 400  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 gunnoise jpg  in your image b lcd   an abbreviation for liquid crystal display  most digital cameras have this color screen on its reverse side  and is mostly used to review captured images or as a viewfinder to compose an image  deciding how and where you wish to take the photo  since memory is the limiting feature on all cameras  poor images should be deleted immediately  the resolution of the lcd is measured in pixels  a higher number of pixels resulting in a sharper image on the screen  in my opinion  a digital camera without an lcd must be avoided like a plague b macro   a function that allows the camera to capture a high resolution image even when the tip of the lens is very near the subject  and is used by naturalists  researchers and hobbyists to photograph small objects such as insects  flowers  sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 northbalwynmumspetunas jpg  coins  stamps and small animals  sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 chippy7daysold jpg  many cameras have this function  though with varying degrees of efficacy  more specialized cameras can capture excellent images even when the tip of the lens is very near the subject  citing an example  the  ricoh caplio rr30  has a  1cm macro 148 function that takes excellent photos even when the lens is 1 centimeter away from the subject b mega burst  continuous shooting   allows the rapid capture of multiple images of the same scene  this creates a slow motion sequence and allows you to observe the strokes in fast ball games such as badminton  basketball and soccer  the rate of shooting is measured in frames  in the case of cameras  this term refers to images  per second  fps  based on my current knowledge  a lower fps rate represents slower shooting  with the capture of fewer images over the same period of time b megabyte  mb b  one million bytes  a measure of the storage capacity of a digital camera  the form of storage may be internal  or in the form of a flash memory card  a higher amount of memory allows you to take more photos on those long holiday trips when you cannot regularly transfer images onto your computer b megapixel   one million pixels  a higher pixel rating represents a larger image that has a higher resolution when compared to low megapixel images  high megapixel images  two megapixels and above  can be blown up to a larger size with less loss of quality  low megapixel  one megapixel or less  images will be perfect on greeting cards  but certainly not on a4 sized paper  i recommend that one purchases a 2 megapixel camera  at the very least b noise   a term used to the point of nausea by some professionals  images are theoretically silent  but noise tends to make images  particularly nightshots  appear grainy b pixelation  pixelization  jaggies   pixels are a collection of small dots that together make up a digital image  as pixel size increases  the jagged or angled edges between adjacent pixels become more obvious  sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 rspcapixelation jpg b red eye   in darker conditions  the pupils of eyes of all living creatures dilate  widens  to take in more light  when the flash is used at this time  light reflects off the insides of the eye  making it appear red in photographs  the red eye reduction system utilizes a flash of light which causes the pupils to constrict before the photo is taken  reducing the chances of red eye in the final image b white balance   this control adjusts the settings of the camera to match the natural or artificial light source in the scene  allowing the camera to reproduce the colors more accurately in the image b digital zoom   this is not a genuine zoom function  the camera digitally magnifies the scene by interpolating  adding pixels to the image  pixels  rather than with the help of optical lenses  the image thus becomes grainier and loses optical quality  digital zoom is measured in increasing multiples such as 2x  two times  3x  three times  and so on  in a similar fashion to magnification b optical zoom   this is a genuine zoom function that is performed with the aid of optical lenses  there is no resulting loss of quality  cameras that have an optical zoom cost much more than those with only a digital zoom  partly because of the additional moving parts  i believe that even amateur photographers should purchase a camera with an optical zoom i note   optical and digital zoom can be combined to achieve the maximum zoom on an image  for example  if a camera has a 3x optical zoom and a 2 5x digital zoom  the total zoom is 7 5x b fujifilm axia slimshot  on 8th november  which was the worst time to get distracted  as my finals had only just begun  my attention was drawn to a segment of a brochure featuring this camera  it was cheap  when compared to other cameras  and extremely compact  the credit card sized camera was only 6mm thick  and had a decent internal memory of 8mb unfortunately  it had no flash and no lcd screen  two things which were deemed mandatory by a more experienced friend  the camera also has no optical or digital zoom  and captures 640 x 480 pixel images  working out to a mere 307 200 pixels  or 0 307 megapixels  which makes it unsuitable except for the most casual of all photographers b kodak easyshare cx4200  the final exam was over on 27th november  and i would have gone straight to the shops after leaving the examination hall  if my mum had not held me back  she told me to save my money instead  the  kodak easyshare cx4200  is an easy to use  2 megapixel camera  is endowed with a 2x digital zoom  and has a respectable storage capacity of 16mb  this seemed attractive initially  because it was well within my budget however  the camera has no optical zoom once i had reached this stage  my dad was convinced i had gone mad 133yet again  though he didn 146t stop me  he wasn 146t keen to watch me make a poor purchase and blow off hundreds of dollars in the process  so he handed me some glossy brochures   147if you want to buy a camera  make sure you do your research first 148  said he 133i was glad i did b ricoh caplio rr30  this was the third camera i researched  though the pricing was a little over my budget  its macro function intrigued me  the camera can photograph objects as near as 1cm away from the lens  the  ricoh caplio rr30  is surprisingly low priced  considering it is a 3 megapixel camera  capable of 3x optical zoom  and has negligible shutter lag  allowing it to capture images in rapid succession but research soon revealed that besides its macro mode  fast shutter release and possibly the included rechargeable batteries  there was little to recommend about this camera  the images were noisy  and were imbued with a strange blue tinge  which was even more apparent in nightshots b canon powershot a40  it took a long while before i finally started researching on this camera  i had ignored it initially  because it seemed expensive when compared to other cameras in its class  and the mediocre information in the brochures pushed me to believe that this was an ordinary device  with nothing to get excited about  despite this   canon  proved the worth of this camera  and eventually pocketed my money i in brief  the  canon powershot a40  is a  2 megapixel   effective  camera  running on  4 standard aa batteries   rather than proprietary ones  with a  3x optical zoom  and a  2 5x digital zoom  function  it features a  manual  mode  which allows the user to control the shutter speed and aperture size  and the interesting  stitch assist  mode for the production of panoramic photos  in addition to this  the camera also boasts a  movie  mode which allows the capture of short clips with audio  it is most amazing to find this feature on a cheaper camera it communicates with the computer only via the  usb port   at this time  the camera is compatible with  windows 98    windows me    windows 2000    windows xp   as well as  mac os 8 6 through to 9 1  and  mac os x 10 1 5 or later   thanks to  placebo3  for correcting me on an error i made in this section i what 146s included i   canon powershot a40    software  canon solution disk version 8 0   arcsoft camera suite 1 1 b   canon powershot a30  a40 camera user guide   179 pages this thick manual looks very daunting  but is actually well structured and easy to comprehend  it includes an excellent contents page  a quick start section  and a comprehensive specification list as well as an index  nearly all sections are laden with diagrams or images to aid learning   canon software starter guide   114 pages this guide is very well done indeed  the information is well organized and all the intricacies of the included software are explained in impeccable detail   interface cable ifc 300pcu  this connects your camera to the computer  via the usb port   av cable avc dc100  the cable links your camera together with your television set  i used this feature to present photos to my family and relatives on the night of 16th december   compactflash card fc 8m  the camera does not have any internal memory  and stores images in a flash memory card  the included card has a capacity of 8mb   wrist strap ws 200  this simple contraption allowed me to fasten the camera securely to my wrist during the first few days  when i didn 146t have a camera case   4 aa alkaline batteries   single use these batteries won 146t last very long  and are expensive to replace  it is estimated that only 200 images can be captured  if the lcd screen is turned on  the optional  canon  nimh  nickel metal hydride  rechargeable batteries would last for 350 images under the same conditions  it is recommended to purchase these or use your existing nimh rechargeable batteries  nicd  nickel cadmium  batteries are not recommended because of their short battery life and are unreliable   system map  this green sheet shows a diagram of the included as well as optional accessories that are available for your camera  it also provides a list of the printers that are capable of utilizing the camera 146s  direct print  function  once the compatible printer is connected to the camera via a cable  images can be printed immediately by using the camera controls i first impression  the  canon powershot a40  is an all plastic  metallic grey camera  measuring 11 03cm x 7 1cm x 3 76cm  w x h x d respectively  it is easy to hold in one hand  but is too large for most pockets  weighing 250g  without batteries  this camera is no lightweight  the construction is exceptionally resilient  and i believe it will withstand the stresses of my future trips to farms or during clinical rounds i the top  this is a relatively uninteresting side which features only the logo   147powershot a40 148 and the  shutter  button  the latter is also termed a  147two stage shutter release 148  the industry standard  when pressed halfway  the camera focuses on the image and adjusts the white balance and exposure  once this is done  the camera beeps  the button can then be depressed fully to capture the image i the front  when viewed from the front  the battery compartment protrudes very markedly on the left  but i find this increasingly useful as a handgrip the  lens  resides around the middle of this side  and can be fitted with optional accessories such as the  wide converter   for taking wide angle  when zoomed out  shots   tele converter   a magnifying lens to aid telephoto  when zoomed in  shots  and the  close up lens   for taking macro shots  this camera features a built in lens cover and eliminates the worry of losing it  especially in  147haystacks 148  such as those in my unkempt room the  microphone  is situated above the lens and records sound monaurally when the camera is in  movie  mode  the optical viewfinder is positioned to the left of the microphone at the top right hand corner of the front face is the  flash  compartment  which is constructed ingeniously because it incorporates an orange red light that functions as an  af assist beam   helps the camera focus  especially in dark conditions  a  red eye reduction lamp  or a  self timer lamp  while we are still viewing the camera from the front  let 146s proceed to review the left and right sides i the left side  there are few features on this side  except for a compartment for the compactflash  cf  card  and a separate compartment for a cr2016 battery  this should last about three years from the date of installation  if not more  which functions to retain the date  and time  the wrist strap eyelet is positioned above the cf card compartment i the right side  hidden underneath a durable rubber flap are three main features which i will discuss in order from top to bottom   digital  terminal  when fitted with the included cable  this port allows the camera to communicate with the computer via its usb port  overall  communication speeds are excellent   a v out  terminal  if the camera is connected to your television via the included cable while you are reviewing your images or video clips  they will appear on the television screen instead of the lcd  the video output signal can be switched between ntsc and pal as required   dc in  terminal  with an optional adapter kit  the camera can be connected to an external power source to allow extended use of the camera without having to stop to change the batteries i the back  the screen is perhaps the most evident feature on this side  it is a  tft color lcd   displaying images at a resolution of 120 000 pixels  this screen performs well under most conditions  is brightly lit  clear  and allows an accurate review and framing of images  under dimmer conditions  the lcd begins to look grainy  but this has no effect on the final image  the viewable area is a mere 3 1cm  and i was certainly expecting a larger screen on this camera the  optical viewfinder  rests above

images or looking through menus  this button is used to move to the right   menu  button  brings up a variety of menus  which vary according to the shooting mode or review mode  the key features of this button are to adjust the  image resolution   1600 x 1200  1024 x 768 or 640 x 480  degree of  compression   superfine  fine and normal  with superfine representing the lowest compression and a higher quality image  changing the  iso   the settings available are 50  100  200  400  auto  and to set the  light metering mode   evaluative or spot metering to the right of the screen are three buttons  from top to bottom  these are the   display  button  used to turn the lcd on or off  or to display detailed information while shooting or reviewing images  in the latter case  this makes it possible to see what camera settings were used to capture an image  and then learn how to adjust the settings accordingly to achieve a better photograph in the future   exposure compensation    white

fruitoff jpg   on  off  button  a nifty silver button that does just what it says  it would be a pain to do without it at the right most end of this side is the  mode dial   which allows you to choose between the following operating modes   replay   review the images that are stored on your cf card  this is the mode to use when you intend to download images from your camera onto your computer   auto   this shooting mode turns your camera into a point and shoot device  the camera does the light metering  iso settings and white balance automatically  this is the best mode to use if you need to take photos immediately after taking the camera out of its box  the downside is that photo effects such as  147sepia 148 are not available   program ae  p b  only the shutter speed and aperture size are set by the camera  other functions such as iso  white balance  photo effects and light metering are set by the user  i find this mode sufficient for all photos taken during the day   manual  m b  a mode for more experienced users  it allows for the manual adjustment of the  shutter speed   ranges from 1 1500 of a second for brightly lit scenes to 15 seconds for dimmer areas  and the  aperture size   a choice of two values between f2 8 and f14 are available at any zoom setting  the  manual  mode is fast becoming my favorite as it allows me to express myself  and is particularly useful for evening  sample  www geocities com doggie zipp 2000 northbalwyneasternfreeway jpg  and nightshots   stitch assist mode   this intriguing feature allows the capture of a sequence of images  from left to right or vice versa  which can then be stitched together into a panoramic photo  samples  www geocities com doggie zipp gallery greatoceanroadlookout2panoramic jpg  with the  photostitch  software that is supplied with the camera  thus far  i 146ve created two panoramic images in this way  and i 146m impressed at how accurately the software can appose adjacent images   movie mode   the camera can capture short movie clips at about 20 fps  at a higher resolution of 320 x 240  the camera records for a maximum of 10 seconds  for longer movie clips  the lower resolution of 160 x 120 allows you to record clips up to 30 seconds long  recording ceases automatically when the time frame elapses  or if your cf card becomes full  whichever occurs first  the movies are also recorded with audio  making it handy for videoing short demonstrations the last  but not least  feature on this side is  zoom button  that is used to activate the digital and optical zoom  while reviewing images  the user can also use this button to magnify the image by up to ten times  and then panning across the image using the  left  and  right  directional buttons i the bottom  only the battery compartment cover and the tripod socket are seen in this area b software  two cds are included in the package  one being the  canon digital camera solution disk  and the other is the  arcsoft camera suite 1 1   the software is compatible with both windows and most macintosh operating systems  as mentioned above the  canon digital camera solution disk  includes   twain driver   a driver file that allows the computer to recognize your camera to allow for downloading of images   zoombrowser ex   the program allows the downloading of camera images onto the computer  organization in a chronological fashion to form a  time tunnel   images are arranged in a simulated tunnel  according to their creation date  which can be zoomed forward or backward as though one were moving through time  converting the camera 146s raw file format into bmp files  this function is redundant since all images on the camera are already in a jpeg format can be opened with  paint   and resize images to create email attachments   photorecord   the main feature of this program is to let the user create electronic photo albums  adding words to describe the image or a personal experience   photostitch   as mentioned before  the program takes the images  shot with the  stitch assist mode   arranges them  and turns them into a panoramic photo  it is accurate  and easy to use  the stitched edges are only vaguely apparent in areas where movement occurred while the photo was taken   remotecapture   when the camera is connected to your computer  the program lets you control the camera 146s shutter button and basic settings remotely from the computer  and images are downloaded immediately onto your computer instead of the cf card the  arcsoft camera suite  cd contains   arcsoft photoimpression   it can be described  quite simply as a jazzed up version of the regular  paint  program on your computer  with this  one can edit images by cropping it  enhancement  sharpen  blur e t c  or via the addition of special effects  the program is very functional and intuitive  and certainly much less of a pain to use than the comparatively primitive  paint    arcsoft videoimpression   this ingenious program allows the user to compile several short movie clips or still images into a movie with dramatic transitions  select from a list of dissolve  wipe  special or fancy effects  and also provides a feature for editing and removing any unwanted frames b conclusion  now that you 146ve come this far  let 146s summarize this review and get this over with as quickly and painlessly as possible i the good 133    excellent image quality   allowing the production of outstanding photos  every time   durable construction  ensures that the camera will outlast some of the tougher challenges   feature packed  yet easy to use  giving even the newest photographers a chance to get their hobby on the road   manual mode  leaves the user with lots of room to grow and experiment   software bundle  was well thought out  filled with features and very user friendly   noise reduction  system was exceptional and all the photos i took appeared to have little or no grain at all  the camera utilizes special processing techniques to reduce noise in images that are taken at shutter speeds slower than 1 3 seconds  this  however  requires a length of processing time which must elapse before the next image can be captured   instruction manuals  are well organized well presented i the bad and the ugly 133   i was shocked when i opened the box  only to realize this camera didn 146t come with a  camera case   since i was due to go sightseeing with my relatives immediately  i depended heavily on the wrist strap for a firm grip  the included  compactflash card  has a capacity of only 8mb  too small for its own good  i recommend purchasing a 64mb card  stores about 64 images  even at the finest quality  which is sufficient for longer trips away from home  it is unfortunate that no  rechargeable batteries  and  charger  were provided  a  four directional pad  instead of just a left and right button would 146ve made reviewing and panning through images a lot easier  the  lcd  is a little too small  even though this isn 146t a serious flaw  images are stored in a  jpeg format   a compression which results in a smaller file  but also causes the loss of some detail  i would have preferred the camera to store the image in a raw format  no detail is lost  which can then be converted to a standard bmp file on the computer   shutter lag  is quite noticeable  causing some delay  about 1 second  before another photo can be taken overall  this camera would make an excellent tool for beginners and hobbyists  but also leaves them with much room to grow  for its price  the  canon powershot a40  is surprisingly powerful and outshines many cameras in the 2 megapixel category  if you are new to the world of digital photography  this is the camera i 146d highly recommend b further reading  b

585,camera, i was not much of a photographer  but my sony mavica fd73 changed my life  digital cameras are an excellent way to take share and store memories  instead of a shoebox full of crumbled and bent glossies  i now have a folder full of files  not only can i view the photos when i want  but i can email them to friends and family  it is fast and fun and the best way to keep friends updated on your activities  i have some friends who regularly send baby photos via email and i always know how the toddler is growing even though we live states away  i think the best aspect of the digital camera is the instant processing you take a shot and can view it from the camera  no need to wait for prints  if you didn t capture the scene you wanted  you simply take the picture again  plus  you can delete all of the bad photos of yourself without anyone knowing it is so user friendly  the screen is easy to use and it is very easy to tab from one menu to another  i prefer sony because you can instantly take the disk to your computer and email it to a friend or print the image  no file conversions  no waiting  quick and easy  software comes with the camera  the new battery technology is getting better and you can charge the battery to last for hours  you will definitely wish to invest in a small camera bag i bought a refurbished camera from the manufacturer and have had no problems with my camera  buying a refurbished camera saved me a couple hundred bucks     ,much photographer sonya mavra ff change life digital camera excellent way take share store memories instead shoebox full crumble bend glass older full file view photo want email friends family fast fun best way keep friends update activities friends regularly send baby photo via email always know toller grow even though live state away think best aspect digital camera instant process take shoot view camera need wait print capture scene want simply take picture plus delete bad photo without anyone know user friendly screen easy use easy tax one menu another prefer sonya instantly take disk computer email friend print image file conversion wait quick easy software come camera new battery technology get better charge battery last hours definitely wish invest small camera bag buy refurbish camera manufacturer problems camera buy refurbish camera save couple hundred buck
586,camera, to start off  this is not a camera for serious photographers  this is a great tech geek toy with mainstream crossover potential   in english  it looks cool  and it 146s easy to use  if you take this out on the street  heads will turn  people will come ask you what it is  it looks awesome  your dog will respect you more  you may be promoted  it 146s that cool  and realistically  they can 146t make them much smaller  or there won 146t be anything to hold on to  so you 146ve reached coolness nirvana  with sound this is not to say it doesn 146t take good pictures  i 146ve been fairly pleased with the output  some of the other reviews can address the technical specs and such  as i don 146t know a whole lot about them  but on the whole  the pictures i 146ve taken are uniformly better than the pictures i 146ve taken with old fashioned 35mm cameras  i bought the camera purely as a point and click device and it works great  what sold me on this model was the size and 30 second videos with sounds  and i 146ve been real happy with the output there some of the cool stuff  the menus are easy to figure out  configuring the settings takes a little getting used to and a bit of tweaking  but you can generally get pictures you like without too much effort  the movies are pretty cool  and the picture on the viewscreen is excellent  it 146s a 1 6 148 screen  which is generally enough to frame the pictures you want  but to reiterate  the coolest thing about this thing is the size  it 146s comes about a millimeter short of fitting inside an altoids tin  and it 146s thinner some of the downsides  first off  cost  not just the unit  which is pricey on its own  but the dang memory cards  i 146m sure these will come down over time  but for right now  the securedisk cards it needs are expensive  one of the consequences of this is that you won 146t want to use the mp3 player functionality much because you 146ll want the space for high quality pictures as for storage space  with the high quality pics i like  you can get about 160 or so on a 128 mb card  the lowest quality size combo here will fit about 1500 in the same space   there are three different sizes  1600x1200  1280 x 960 and 640x480  and three qualities  fine  normal and economy if you 146re cheap  you can get by for a while on the native 12mb memory  which is also pretty cool oh  and did i mention it 146s an mp3 player  while this is kinda cool on paper  and while showing it off  i haven 146t used this yet  and don 146t expect to  unless the cards become free  it does come with a nice remote for the mp3 functionality  with readout and all  but it seems a bit tacked on  it 146s almost like this is just too much while the pictures are great straight on  once you start using the zoom  they get pretty fuzzy  it goes to 4x digital zoom  and the picture starts to degrade fairly quickly i 146m also constantly afraid i 146m going to lose it  i lose my keys all the time  and they 146re way bigger than this is  as for the movies  i 146ve been pretty impressed  but the size is limiting  while 30 seconds is generally long enough to get what i want  the maximum size is 320x240  that 146s just pretty tiny  still  quality is ok the software that ships with the camera is ok  the photo loader is a convenient archive  but the photo editor is a waste  the cradle is nice and small though  and it has usb connectivity  so i can plug it straight into my keyboard  nice feature i 146ve been very pleased with the battery life  if you 146re fairly conservative  i e  turning it off after you take a picture  you can go a few weeks without a charge and that about sums it up  there are a lot of features here i didn 146t cover  some are things i don 146t use  like the ability to take audio notes  or annotate photos with sounds  some are things i just don 146t have comments on  like the best shot feature  which sets up the camera for certain shots automatically  on the whole  this camera is an excellent purchase  i 146m glad i got it  it defines portability  and now i have a camera with me everywhere i go if you 146ve got the cash for it  and are just looking for some point and click fun  this is for you  ,start camera serious photographer great teach week toy mainstream crossover potential english look cool easy use take street head turn people come ask look awesome dog respect may promote cool realistically make much smaller anything hold reach coolness nirvana sound say take good picture fairly please output review address technical speck know whole lot whole picture take

587,camera, 1  can you see the picture of the camera direct on tv using av cable  i think elph has ntsc output  where as here it is ixus v with pal color video out yes  there is a proprietary cable that connect the elph to tv  usb or the canon printer  the tv output is on normal rca jacks  one more for mono sound since this can take small movies  it can output both pal and ntsc  mine is set obviously on ntsc  ixus v is the same   my manual has that on it too  2  can you record the audio of the picture  few seconds yes  i need to get a big memory stick  i am waiting for deals to show up  the resolution is not that great in video mode  sound sensitivity is pretty good for the size of the camera  3  have you synchronized the camera direct with pc using serial port or usb only usb comes with it  i have left the usb cable attached and just plug the camera back and forth 4  how many pictures you can take per minute or what is the time required to take consecutive pictures this is not a professional camera at all  it does take a second or so before it takes the pictures  usually i can do around one picture every 2 seconds  it does have continuous picture mode  but that does not work real well   fast enough  i do not have exact numbers 5  the memory stick size you have 8m or 16m or both  can the memory stick keep the pictures if you remove it out of he camera and for how long mem stick is called the compact flash   available from anyone  i do not recommend the memory stick  because as betamax  it is proprietary sony technology  and eventually  they will have to keep up with compact flash and the other memory flash product  this is flash memory so it stays good all the time  i can use the same card in other cameras and move it back to my camera and still continue using it  i have 8m  i get a free 16m that i will apply for  rebate  and in a couple of weeks   jan or so  i will buy a 80 96 or 128mb card 7  can you resize the photo direct from the camera by panning and tilting the picture for editing before saving it to the memory only thing camera can do is rotate pics  everything else is done on the computer  the coolest program is one that stitches pictures together  that way  i can get a good panoramic picture 8  can you also change the resolution of the camera after picture has been taken at highest resolution no  only view it 9  any more useful experience many  the flash is tiny  if i take a picture indoors  the flash only illuminates the item if it is within 3 feet  else it looks real bad  also  everyone still gets red eye  indoor  also has a problem with good balancing  also  many pictures were coming out to be blurred  was disappointed with results in low light  outdoor pics are much nicer  10  what is the battery type lith ion and what is the capacity  how often you need to recharge lith ion  since operation requires that you use the lcd  it eats up after around a 100 pictures  after which i have to recharge  11  the tft screen is the color screen visible in day light yes  it is quite bright and high res  i do like the camera  it does have its flaws  which do not allow for professional to semi professional photography  also  the lcd does not have a protective cover  which i think is really dumb  last  the curvature of the flash and red eye flash make it impossible to clean if dust comes on it  last  it is made in japan

588,camera,  the mavica became so frustrating i didn t want to use it anymore b it wasn t the camera s fault  it was mine for not fully investigating the function of the camera and for not matching my purchase to my shooting style  though the nikon coolpix series doesn t sport the fancy add ons like the cd writer or image stabilization  the 950 would fit my photography and my habits where the mavica cd1000 does not  this is my followup review  you can read my original mavica cd1000 review from the list below b for starters  the wide angle can hardly be called wide  i brought the cd1000 with me on my recent trip to europe  i spent two weeks walking around and seeing the sights  most of it without the sony  why  sheer frustration at the lens and my inability to capture any wide views  i ve often thought of switching from my nikons to canon eos just so i could use their amazing 20 35 2 8 zoom as i think that may be my ideal walking lens i see the world through a very wide field of view and that s how i also like to shoot  i prefer the sense of perspective from a sharp but not exaggerated wide angle  the barrel distortion on the mavica was simply too much for me and i put the camera away in my luggage with barely a few shots taken the sony cd1000 sports a measly 39mm slr equivalent lens  my standard slr lenses are a 24 and a 105  how could i be happy with a maximum wide view of 39  i was hoping the wide angle adapter would help  but poor image quality and horrible viginetting left me wondering at how blind i was to drop  1500 on a system that i can t consider functional b it s all about personal preference  for those digital shooters coming over from the sony camcorder world  the mavica will make you feel right at home  everyone i showed the cd1000 initially thought it was a video camera  to me  the long telephoto attached to the still camera just doesn t seem like a good idea considering the inherent delays make capturing sports images impossible  i would much prefer a wider view and less range on the zoom i like to shoot from the hip and the nikon coolpix seems so much more flexible with it s rotating body  the large sony just felt clunky and hard to get a good grip on  not to mention the pitiful manual focus ring  in summary  my cd1000 is for sale  including the external flash  no complaints  and the wide angle adapter bid now  low reserve   http cgi ebay com aw cgi ebayisapi dll viewitem amp item 469259888   ,mavra become frustration want use anymore camera fault mine fully investigation function camera watch purchase shoot style though union coolpix series sport fancy add like writer image stabilization would fit photography habit mavra follow review read original mavra review list state wide angle hardly call wide bring recent trip europe spend two weeks walk around see sight without sonya sheer frustration lens inability capture wide view often think twitch unions canon os could use amaze room think may ideal walk lens see world wide field view also like shoot prefer sense perspective sharp exaggerate wide angle barrel distortion mavra simply much put camera away luggage barely shots take sonya sport meanly mm sir equivalent lens standard sir lenses could happy maximum wide view hop wide angle adapt would help poor image quality horrible viginetting leave wonder blind drop system consider functional personal preference digital shutter come sonya camcorder world mavra make feel right home everyone show initially think video camera long telephone attach still camera seem like good idea consider inherent delay make capture sport image impossible would much prefer wider view less range room like shoot hip union coolpix seem much flexible rotate body large sonya felt cling hard get good grip mention pitiful manual focus ring summary sale include external flash complaints wide angle adapt bid low reserve http chi bay com chi ebayisapi viewitem amp item

590,auto, after many years of honda devotion  we re now part of the vw family  we ve had a 2000 passat wagon for 5 weeks now and we love it  and here s why  keep in mind that we ve been driving a 1990 honda civic hatchback for 10 years  turbo rocks  the car s natural peppiness is helping me in my attempt at curtailing my turbonium indulgence  it has nice handles  sure  the door handles are comfortable  but the attention to detail really shows itself in little things like the cargo area cover s handle  which is covered by a little flap to keep riff raff from peeking in through the handle at your stuff  and the hinged above the door handles  which snap up out of the way when not in use  after an afternoon parked in the sun  we can turn and hold the key in the driver s side door to open all the windows and let out the hot air  turning and holding the other way closes all the windows plus the sunroof  i find myself  quot forgetting quot  to close windows before getting out of the car just so i can do this  though once the engine s turned off  you still have some time to close the power windows  driving at night is an aesthetic experience  the panel lights are blue  the dealer told us it s for ergonomic reasons  but we suspect it s really because it looks cool  i like playing with the trip computer  it s entertaining  i watch my instantaneous mileage go from 12mpg uphill to 56mpg down the back of the hill  it s a competition  i try to keep average mileage as high as possible  it s informative  how far and how long was this trip here are my gripes  the key is enormous  it feels like i ve got a big rock in my pants pocket  the cruise controls are clumsy  they re clustered on the turn signal stick in such a way that  after peering around the steering wheel  drifting into a brief visit with the road shoulder  to figure out where they are  you ve got to take one hand from the steering wheel to adjust it  trying it with your hands still on the wheel results in flashing your bright headlights  the glove compartment is big enough for the vw manual you get  but not much else  there are plenty of other compartments throughout the car for stashing maps and such  but we d prefer to keep them all together  the front cup holder is terrible  it flips out at an angle  toward the passenger seat  obscuring the ashtray  which is the best place we ve found for keeping change  so approaching a tollbooth with the cup holder out is a harrowing experience  it s shallow with rubber grippers inside  to keep the cups snug  too snug  as it turns out  since we can t wrestle styrofoam coffee cups and aluminum cans from the holder without spilling and cursing  we now take 2 cups when ordering coffee  one cup stays in the holder and becomes the actual holder of the full cup  on our car the trim panel on the inside of the back cargo lid is loose  after a visit to the dealer  it s still loose  they ve threatened to replace the whole  quot back end quot  whatever that means i m known to buy stuff based solely on its design  the experience it affords  its attention to detail  now that i m living with the car  i m learning where that attention to detail slipped  but in spite of the gripes above  i ll repeat myself  we love it br br  ,many years hand devotion part family pass wagon weeks love keep mind drive hand civic hunchback years turn rock car natural happiness

593,camera, when i first started looking a digital cameras  i didn t know that much about them  i am much more familiar with 35mm slr s and medium format cameras  i will try to pass on what i have learned and why i think the  hewlett packard photo smart c30  is a good deal when looking for a digital camera  i believe you need to look for several major features  the first of which is the resolution  or the amount of pixels that are contained in a photograph pixels are kind of like the the grain of a negative  the more pixels you have  the better the photo will hold together when you try to enlarge a photograph  the same is true with a negative  the more smaller the grain  or the more you have basically  the better the image enlarges  the hp c30 has one megapixel resolution  1152x872  this is the resolution at its highest setting  there are three settings on this camera  each setting progressively reduces the amount of resolution that a photo contains  this is a great feature when you are trying to save room on your memory card this leads to the second thing you need to look for when deciding on a digital camera  the memory of a digital camera is in essence the film you are shooting your photos on  some of the cheaper cameras do not have a removable or upgrade able memory card the hp c30 i bought came with a 8mb compact flash card  the memory card is about one and half inches square  this makes in convenient if you want to carry more than one card  the memory cards can also be bought with more memory allowing you to store more photos with out having to change the card or downloading images  you can store 17 superfine images  40 fine images  and 80 basic images another very important thing to look at when deciding which digital camera to buy is the way in which you download photos to the pc  the hp c30 is downloaded to the computer through you serial port  the camera comes with a 9 pin serial pc cable  this is slow process and i think it is the major drawback of this camera  a usb download would have been much more beneficial additionally  you want to be aware of the type of power source that it needs  if you buy a camera that is a battery guzzler  you can be out of luck when you really need it or want it  the hp c30 uses four aa batteries  if i buy good alkaline batteries  i get much longer use of the camera before i have to change them  hewlett packard estimates that the camera s battery life is like this  500 photos without a flash  and 200 photos with a flash  i would say that this a pretty good estimate lastly  in identifying a good digital camera in my opinion is what kind of accessories the camera comes with  this includes the software  this camera came with microsoft picture it  and hp photo smart photo finishing software  i personally love the hp software  it makes downloading the photos very easy  this program is also good when balancing color and exposure  another great part of this program is the way it allows you to print the photos  it s got a great feature called paper saver  allowing you get the most out of your photo printing paper one thing to look for is an lcd display  but i don t believe that it is as important  this is usually for a preview post view display  the hp c30 comes with a 1 8 quot  color display  although using it to take the picture is a little hard  this is due to the fact that it is not like a typical video camera image but refreshes the image every second  making the image appear to skip around another great feature of this camera is the fact that you can display your images on a television  the camera comes with a cable that can be hooked into the television  then you can slide show the photos in your camera  in addition  you can record the slide show onto a video tape to create easy and lasting memories  or to torment your family and friend with  i do recommend using the ac adapter while doing this so as not to drain your batteries b overall this is a great camera for the money b  i did buy this camera about a year ago  and at the time it was the biggest bang for the buck  i think in comparing digital cameras today that are available  that it is still is a great buy b here are the specs 1 megapixel resolution 2x digital zoom 24 bit color iso 100 exposure system mechanical shutter 1 500 to 4 seconds color 1 8 quot  lcd display normal focus

595,auto, recently our 12 year old nissan stanza decided it was time to retire so my wife and i went out car shopping  we ended up buying a 2003 kia spectra  it seemed like a nice car  fit and finish is good and the factory stereo sounds really nice for a oem job  we now have 9000 miles on it and the engine is just starting to get broke in  the power and mileage was poorer than i had thought it should be but now it is coming to life  we get about 31mpg  as long as we keep our feet out of it  with the automatic and it can hold it s own on the freeway  there are a couple drawbacks to freeway driving  the road noise on concrete and older pavement surfaces is really bad  we had to install thick floor mats to help dampen this out and it is still loud  also if you plan to put two adults in the back seat be advised that the little kia will want to wander side to side as the front end gets a bit light from the weight of the rear occupants  the ride quality is pretty good  the seats are comfy and it has very ample leg room so long drives aren t too bad  just keep the stereo up a bit to cancel the road noise  i do my own oil changes on a lift so i had a chance to check out the underside of my kia  most of it looks pretty good down there except for the rear axle mounts  they look to me a bit on the small side  the automatic transmission is a bit on the shift happy side  it shifts to overdrive at any speed even at 25 mph  this makes the engine sound like it is lugging a bit  i usually keep the transmission out of overdrive in town  one nice thing about the interior are all the little nick nacks kia has engineered into it  the overhead sunglass holder is just neat  as are the individual map lights  the cup holders are adjustable in size and the little cubby in the rear of the center console is nice since the top of the lid also opens up to store small items  all in all it isn t a bad little car for the money  would i buy one again  i think not  should you  depends on your prioraties  ,recently year old nissan stanza decide time retire wife go car shop end buy kit specters seem like nice car fit finish good factory sterno sound really nice dem job miles engine start get break power mileage poorer think come life get pg long keep feet automatic hold freely couple drawback freely drive road noise concrete older pavement surface really bad install thick floor mat help damper still loud also plan put two adults back seat advise little kit want wander side side front end get bite light weight rear occupants ride quality pretty good seat come ample leg room long drive bad keep sterno bite cancel road noise oil change lift chance check undermine kit look pretty good except rear able mount look bite small side automatic transmission bite shift happy side shift overdrive speed even may make engine sound like lag bite usually keep transmission overdrive town one nice thing interior little nick back kit engineer overhead spyglass holder neat individual map light cup holders adjustable size little chubby rear center console nice since top lid also open store small items bad little car money would buy one think depend prioraties

598,auto, i waited to write this until i have had 4 months of driving my 2000 kia sportage my wife has honda crv and i leased a toyota rav4 for three years so i have a fair amount of knoledge on suv s  i got the car in forest green which is really pleasing too the eye and the dealership through in tinting and keyless entry it really is a sharp looking suv  i am 6 2 and it has the most leg room of any suv in its class which is kinda interesting since it tends to be a few inches shorter than most suv s the back seat is tight especially if the front passengers are above 5 9 the interior is very basic and simple so do not look for a lot of bells and whistles  one thing that is interesting is that they did put money into one area using a thick truck frame instead of a car frame also because it is slightly shorter than most suv s and the wheelbase is comparable to most  the tipping problem seemes to be lessened i have taken pretty sharp turns and the kia did not show any signs of tipping the electrical problems that occured in previous years has been fixed so there is no problem there  the engine is solid and comparable to others but goes through a breaking through period where it actually has better pickup a month after you drive it than when off the lot  130hp  a little noisy but no big deal decent pickup but not great if you are used to 6 or 8 cylinders you might be disapointed when it is windy and you are going more than 75 mph on the parkway you will feel it this is not a cadillac or a porsche  it is not for great speed or luxorious comfort it is a great looking very fun to drive car however for around town it is great  and short road trips it is a real pleasure the radio could be better with stations that could come in clearer and the position of the rear speakers even though they are good sounding are very poorly placed the front speakers are interesting with tweaters right by the window for great highs a little trick is to take the covers off the rear speakers my ultimate solution was to get a pair of 6 9 speaker and enclosers for the back and problem solved if you dont know what im talking about and high quality sound is important plenty of places will set help you like circuit city speak to the installers not the salespeople by the way i am now at 8 months and not one problem lovin this suv  ,wait write months drive kit shortage wife hand cry lease tooth run three years fair amount knowledge sun get car forest green really please eye leadership tilt sexless entry really sharp look sun leg room sun class kind interest since tend inch shorter sun back seat tight especially front passengers interior basic simple look lot bell whistle one thing interest put money one area use thick truck frame instead car frame also slightly shorter sun wheelbase comparable tap problem seem lessen take pretty sharp turn kit show sign tap electrical problems occur previous years fix problem engine solid comparable others go break period actually better pick month drive lot little noisy big deal decent pick great use cylinders might disappoint windy go may parkman feel cadillac porch great speed luxurious comfort great look fun drive car however around town great short road trip real pleasure radio could better station could come clearer position rear speakers even though good sound poorly place front speakers interest theaters right window great high little trick take cover rear speakers ultimate solution get pair speaker enclose back problem solve dont know talk high quality sound important plenty place set help like circuit city speak instal salespeople way months one problem love sun
599,auto, i have been a montero owner since about 1985 and have found these vehicles to be extremely reliable and dependable  i have owned several of them and would buy another  if there is a downside  it is the availability of parts when needed and the dealer network in the southwest is a bit thin the montero itself is a tough vehicle compared with its competition and serves well as an off road machine  which is the kind of use that i give it  it is well suited for farm and ranch use as well as for hunting  generally speaking  it seems to outlast many other sport utilites in its class properly maintained  it is a strong performer although a bit underpowered for its size and weight overall  i would recommend that anyone in the market for a true sports utility vehicle put the montero on their  quot short list quot  to investigate as a long term ownership car that will last a long time as a used vehicle  it is usually underestimated when it is offered with somewhat hight mileage on the odometer most comepetetive sport utes can be consideree pretty well worn at 100k miles a well cared for montero can be a very good value for the used car buyer who is willing to take the time to check one out  and they are usually available at attractive prices on the used market br br  ,monster owner since find vehicles extremely reliable dependable own several would buy another downside availability part need dealer network southwest bite thin monster tough vehicle compare competition serve well road machine kind use give well suit farm ranch use well hunt generally speak seem outcast many sport utilities class properly maintain strong performer although bite underpowered size weight overall would recommend anyone market true sport utility vehicle put monster quit short list quit investigate long term ownership car last long time use vehicle usually underestimate offer somewhat right mileage odometer competitive sport use consider pretty well wear miles well care monster good value use car buyer will take time check one usually available attractive price use market br
